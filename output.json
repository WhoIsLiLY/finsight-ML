Bitcoin rocketed toward $100,000 last week but pulled back just shy of the milestone in recent days. The six-digit mark is a stiff resistance level and psychological selling point for investors, a source told Business Insider. Even if the correction deepens, analysts still expect bitcoin to top $100,000 this year. The crypto market held its breath last week as bitcoin verged on breaking through the $100,000 mark, only to be disappointed as the momentum stalled and then sharply reversed course. The token's price reached a record of $99,655.5 on Friday, but fell back just before crossing the six-digit milestone. As of 2:53 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency traded at $91,749, nearly an 8% drop from its all-time peak. Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, explained that the $100,000 level serves as a psychological selling point for investors who have held onto bitcoin since its last bull run. He told Business Insider that token holders likely anticipated declines around the price point and chose to sell some holdings to lock in gains. The same behavior can be traced back previous highs in bitcoin's price, he said. \"A similar pattern emerged earlier this year in March when bitcoin lingered near its previous all-time high of $69K from 2021 for almost seven days before eventually breaking through,\" Mena told BI in an email. \"As the price approached this level, many participants from the last cycle began taking profits, anticipating a potential sell-off.\" Other analysts said there are other factors that can also be blamed for bitcoin's deepening correction. FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich pointed to easing geopolitical tensions between Lebanon and Israel, reducing investors' appetite for safe-haven assets like bitcoin. In a note on Tuesday morning, Standard Chartered added that this week's falling US Treasury term premium could also be a culprit. Bitcoin tends to edge up as yields fall. While yields moved higher in the wake of Donald Trump's latest tariff announcements on Monday, the 10-year yield has come down from three-month highs it reached earlier in the month following the election. If bitcoin's price continues breaking lower, it could fall as far as $80,000, Mena told BI. He said that crypto-focused options traders confirm this thinking, with options contracts expiring in December betting heavily on bitcoin sinking to $80,000. \"The $80K support level is likely the extent of this correction, which could ultimately be healthy for the market,\" he said. \"Bitcoin often retests previous support levels to consolidate strength and shake out leveraged positions and weak hands.\" To be sure, before bitcoin reaches this level, it would first retest several support levels above that. The next key threshold below $90,000 to watch is $87,000, Mena noted. After a drop to this level, Standard Chartered expects bitcoin could resume its rise. Mena also still expects bitcoin to rally into the year-end, with the holiday season helping the token rally to a range of $110,000-$120,000. \"During these holiday gatherings, investors often share their excitement about bitcoin and crypto with family and friends, discussing their gains and sharing their [Profit and Loss],\" Mena told BI: \"This can spark curiosity and interest, bringing new investors into the space and onboarding new users. This is something we have seen play out in previous years.\" He also expects crypto investors to front-run the presidential inauguration in January, which is what happened before November's election day as investors bid up crypto prices in their excitement for Trump's eventual victory. \"This preemptive activity could generate the momentum needed to push Bitcoin beyond the $100K mark.\" Investors have been hugely excited about Trump's second term. The president-elect has voiced support for crypto, teased the creation of a national bitcoin reserve, and is reportedly screening candidates for a crypto-focused White House role.

The pound was muted against the US dollar in early European trading on Wednesday, hovering around the $1.2600 mark as traders await a raft of US economic figures, including the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. Investors will focus on core PCE inflation data as it is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure for decision-making on interest rates. The inflation data will influence market expectations for the Fed's likely interest rate action in its December meeting. \"The highlight of today’s session will be the release of the US October core PCE deflator, expected at 0.3% MoM. Even though the market has largely moved on from the US inflation story, a sticky reading will add to doubts that the Fed needs to cut in December after all. Expect the dollar to largely hold recent gains, although month-end selling remains a risk,\" ING said. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability for the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25%-4.50% in the December meeting has increased to 65% from 56% a week ago.

Meanwhile, the pound remained largely unchanged against the euro (GBPEUR=X), trading at €1.1974. Gold prices bounced back after sinking over 3% in previous sessions as the demand for safe-haven assets surges once again and the dollar weakens. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $2,653.39 per ounce, while US gold futures climbed 1.2% to $2,651.90 at the time of writing. \"Gold has been fluctuating alongside dollar volatility. Until we get more US economic data, the story remains about Federal Reserve policy, tariffs, and their impact on the dollar,\" said Kyle Rodda, financial market analyst at Capital.com. \"In the long run, I think Trump's trade war may be positive for gold because of higher debt loads and a touch of dedollarisation.\" Goldman Sachs (GS) expects gold prices to reach $3,150 per ounce in a bullish scenario by December 2025, a 19% increase from current levels, as the precious metal continues to be a good hedge against sticky inflation and rising geopolitical issues. Read more: European bank stock picks for 2025, according to Deutsche Bank A large part of this price rise, according to the investment bank, will also be fuelled by higher demand from global central banks coupled with concerns over US fiscal sustainability, trade tensions and wars. “We keep our $3,000 December 2025 forecast. The structural driver of our bullish gold forecast is higher demand from central banks (adding 9% to the gold price by December 2025 relative to our November $2,640 forecast),\" wrote analysts at Goldman Sachs led by Daan Struyven, head of commodities research. Oil prices were higher on Wednesday as traders assessed the potential impact of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah and Sunday's OPEC+ meeting, in which the group could delay a planned increase to oil output. Brent crude futures rose 0.3%, trading at $72.52 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CL=F) rose by the same margin to $68.97 per barrel at the time of writing. \"Market participants are assessing whether the ceasefire will be observed,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, part of Nissan Securities, according to Reuters. \"We expect WTI to trade within the range of $65-$70 a barrel, factoring in weather conditions during the Northern Hemisphere's winter, a potential increase in shale oil and gas production under the incoming Donald Trump administration in the US and demand trends in China.\" In broader market movements, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) opened higher, gaining 0.1% to 8,269.91 points.

Anticipation of an agreement had helped push gold down by more than 3% on Monday. Gold is still up more than 25% this year on easing US monetary policy and heightened geopolitical risks, but has been hit by a stronger dollar this month in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory. However, it didn’t react significantly on Tuesday to the president-elect’s threat of 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which buoyed the greenback.

The pound weakened against the US dollar in early European trading, dropping 0.1% to $1.2551. The move came after president-elect Donald Trump warned of more aggressive tariffs on North American economies, intensifying trade tensions. The US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB), which measures the greenback against six major currencies, saw a strong start following Trump’s comments that he plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over illicit drugs being smuggled into the US through Mexico. Additionally, he threatened a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Trump made the remarks via his Truth Social platform, framing the tariffs as a necessary step to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. In particular, he accused China of failing to fulfil promises related to the death penalty for fentanyl traffickers. “Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States,” Trump said. While the tariff threat against China drew attention, it was his comments on Canada that sent shockwaves through the foreign exchange markets. Trump vowed to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all goods from both Canada and Mexico, pledging to sign an executive order on his first day in office.

Market participants appeared to digest the possibility of Trump nominating Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, a move that could provide geopolitical stability while aligning with his economic agenda. In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent indicated that while tariffs would remain a focus, their implementation would be “layered in gradually”. Meanwhile, the pound remained largely unchanged against the euro (GBPEUR=X), trading at €1.1970. Gold prices held steady on Tuesday following a significant drop of more than 3% in the previous session. Spot gold was unchanged at $2,613.98 per ounce, while US gold futures were muted at $2,616.90 at the time of writing The precious metal suffered a sharp decline on Monday after reports suggested that Israel was nearing a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. Additionally, news of Trump’s nomination of Bessent dampened gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with its value typically rising during periods of heightened risk, such as trade wars or military conflicts. However, some market participants see Bessent’s appointment as potentially less negative for the trade war outlook, which could weaken demand for gold, according to UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

These indicators are expected to provide further direction for gold prices in the coming days. Oil prices recovered on Tuesday, reversing the downward trend from the previous session, as the anticipated ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon appeared less imminent than initially expected, dampening earlier optimism. Brent crude futures rose 0.1%, trading at $72.54 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CL=F) rose 0.6% to $69.35 per barrel at the time of writing. A ceasefire would mark a significant step toward reducing tensions in the Middle East and could alleviate concerns over potential oil supply disruptions. Biden has also been pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza, adding to expectations of a broader resolution. However, oil prices continue to face downward pressure, particularly due to the strength of the US dollar, which surged on news of Trump’s threats to impose import tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. The stronger dollar undermined demand for oil, making it more expensive for holders of other currencies. Additionally, the risk premium on oil remains a key concern, particularly in light of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow's threats of nuclear retaliation in response to Kyiv’s use of Western-supplied long-range missiles have added to the uncertainty in the global oil market, keeping prices volatile.

As scrutiny around Apple and Google's app store fees ramps up around the world, Roblox is now offering users who buy its game currency, Robux, on the web and via gift cards 25% more than they would get if they purchased from an app store instead. In essence, the company is encouraging users to purchase Robux from the web to avoid Apple and Google's in-app purchase fee markups. The company confirmed the move and said that it is looking for ways to provide more value to user and creator communities. \"Apple and Google are valued partners. We are always looking for ways to pass on more value to our user and creator community while managing costs. Going forward, we are providing up to +25% more Robux for any customer that purchases Robux through the web, computer, or with gift cards,\" a Roblox spokesperson told TechCrunch. In a Roblox developer forum post, Roblox specified that this is not a holiday offer, and is a long-term change. Epic Games' CEO Tim Sweeny, who has been fighting with Apple and Google over app store charges, applauded this move. \"Awesome to see Roblox finally fighting the Apple tax. I hope that the current Epic v Apple contempt of court proceeding stops Apple’s ludicrous scare screens and junk fees so that all apps can send users to web-based payments and pass on the savings like this,\" he said in a post on X. In August, Epic launched its Epic Games Store in the EU on iOS, and on Android across the world. In Europe, companies are looking to launch alternative app stores on iOS, thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Meanwhile, startups like Appcharge are helping publishers sell their games outside of Apple and Google's ecosystems.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Global smartphone sales rebounded strongly in 2024 after two successive years of decline, but Apple Inc. barely managed growth, an independent study showed, underscoring the speed with which Android-based rivals are gaining ground in China and emerging markets. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Apple and its rivals will ship 6.2% more phones or an estimated 1.24 billion units in 2024, according to market tracker IDC. But iPhone volumes likely edged just 0.4% higher. Still, Apple remains by far the profit leader with an average selling price surpassing $1,000, while Android rivals collectively came in at around $295, IDC estimates. The latest study highlights the uneven recovery of the smartphone market, which slumped in the post-Covid era despite the advent of AI. Much of that 2024 growth came from pent-up demand and regions with lower smartphone penetration, IDC said. More affordable devices from Android vendors helped Chinese brands better capture that opportunity, while Apple is forecast to fare better next year. The addition of artificial intelligence enhancements, a big theme among the likes of Samsung Electronics Co., Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, failed to excite consumers. “While GenAI continues to be a hot topic and top priority for many vendors, it is yet to impact demand significantly and drive early upgrades,” said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC. “More investments are needed to increase consumer awareness and introduce a ‘must have’ feature that will rush consumers to the store and create that super cycle which everyone is waiting for.” Brands like Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. are pouring investment into hardware and designing their own processors — in a bid to mitigate the threat or effects of US sanctions while customizing their designs for AI use cases. Huawei on Tuesday introduced its latest smartphone powered by its made-in-China chips, while Xiaomi is preparing an in-house semiconductor for 2025 devices. In China’s highly competitive market, where a half-dozen companies trade the top spot each quarter, large and prolonged discounts stimulated sales. Those had more of an effect than in the previous year, though concern about the country’s ailing economy is likely to persist. Globally, shipments have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, and IDC doesn’t expect anything more than low-single-digit growth for years to come. Lengthening times between upgrades, market saturation in developed economies and a rapidly growing trade in used smartphones are seen as the major factors contributing to stagnation. --With assistance from Gao Yuan.

                "content": "   Manage your account  President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House is expected to be largely negative for the electric vehicle industry, given his years of past opposition and personal distaste for the technology. His team has already started plotting out his anti-EV moves. Trump’s transition team is reportedly planning to get rid of the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases as part of a broader tax shakeup, which is likely to slam sales. The credits are part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Trump has said he wants to scrap, and are seen as a major driver of the EV transition. In just three months, EV buyers saved $600 million thanks to those credits, the Treasury Department said. “The tax incentive is important,” Aaron Viles, the senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, told Quartz earlier this year. With most early adopters — people most interested or invested in the tech — already owning an EV, automakers need to reach the consumers concerned about high vehicle costs. More than a dozen EVs are eligible for the full tax credit — and several more that are eligible for a smaller credit would become more expensive if Trump axes the credit. Here are the electric vehicles to buy while the tax credit is still active. Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y SUV, Model X crossover SUV, and Model 3 compact all qualify for the full tax credit, while the company’s Cybertruck pickup and Model S luxury car do not. According to the Energy Department, whether each specific model is eligible for the full tax credit depends on its model year. For example, the 2024 Model Y equipped with rear-wheel drive is eligible, as is the 2023-2025 Model Y Performance. The only version of the Model X eligible for the tax credit is the 2023-2025 model year equipped with an all-wheel drive. As for the Model 3, the Energy Department notes that the eligibility of the 2025 Model 3 Long Range equipped with all-wheel drive may vary. On the whole, Tesla is among the automakers expected to be least affected by a plan to axe the Inflation Reducation Act, given its dominance in the market. CEO Elon Musk has said that in the long term, it “probably actually helps Tesla,” and he wants all tax credits for both electric vehicles and gas-powered cars to be removed. A handful of Chevrolet (GM) cars qualify for the full tax credit, including the Blazer SUV. Both the 2024 and 2025 model year Blazers qualify for the credit, according to the Department of Energy. The Blazer was the first Chevy vehicle made on General Motors’ Ultium platform, which has since been renamed and came out with a rocky launch. However, reviews for the Blazer have become much more positive over the last several months. Chevy’s 2022 and 2023 Bolt EV and Bolt EUV also qualify, although GM discontinued those vehicles at the end of last year. However, the Bolt is set for a comeback in 2025. The second-generation Chevy Bolt will be the company’s most affordable model and lead a new family of vehicles when it launches in late 2025, GM President Mark Reuss said last month, according to Automotive News. The Cadillac Lyriq has emerged as a dominating force in the luxury EV market. From January through September, more than 20,000 units were sold in the U.S., establishing it as the best-selling mid-size electric SUV so far in 2024. The $7,500 tax credit applies to purchases of both the 2024 and 2025 Lyriq, which has helped consumers interested in buying the unit, which starts at $58,590. In October, General Motors said the Lyriq would become the first EV in its portfolio to earn the V-Series performance badge. The 2026 Lyriq-V SUV will launch early next year in the U.S. and a handful of other markets, according to the company. The Acura ZDX SUV is the only electric vehicle offered by the luxury division of Honda (HMC) Motor — and the result of a collaboration with General Motors. The 2024 ZDX is made alongside the Cadillac Lyriq in Spring Hill, Tennessee, sharing the same platform, batteries, and electric motors, although their designs are drastically different. Each of the ZDX’s trims is eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, as even the priciest — the ZDX Type S with performance tiers and wheels costs $74,500. German car giant Volkswagen (VWAGY) has just one model that qualifies for the tax credit, the ID.4 SUV, which comes in a variety of trims that are eligible. The Department of Energy lists both the 2023 and 2024 model year ID.4 as eligible, which are produced at Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Both the ID.4 and the ID.3 are set to get a major overhaul in 2026, including a return to the more traditional two-box silhouette and other simple design features, according to Auto Express. Ford Motor Co.’s (F) award-winning electric truck has been one of the best-known electric vehicles to come out of the U.S. in recent years. Sales of the F-150 Lightning more than doubled last quarter to 7,162 units sold. The full tax credit applies to the 2022-2025 F-150 Lightning with both standard-range and extended-range batteries, which has helped boost sales. Ford has also offered a series of incentives to boost sales and slashed prices. The Detroit automaker is also offering a deal that lets customers lease a 2024 F-150 Lightning that includes $3,500 in Electric Vehicle Red Carpet Lease Cash and $3,000 in Bonus Cash, according to CarBuzz. The 2024-2025 Equinox electric SUV is the last Chevrolet vehicle that can qualify for the $7,500 tax credit. The Equinox debuted in May as one of the more affordable EVs currently available. Last quarter — the first full sales quarter since Equinox deliveries began — more than 15,000 units were sold. In October, General Motors confirmed that the lower-priced Chevy Equinox EV LT is available for order. With the tax credit, prices could be brought down to as low as $27,495, Electrek reported. Chrysler’s (STLA) Pacifica plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is the only hybrid currently eligible for the entire $7,500 tax credit, according to the Energy Department. That gives the model a bit of an edge over its fully-electric rivals for consumers hesitant to entirely ditch the reliability of a gas-powered vehicle, as well as a pricing advantage over its fellow hybrids sold by the likes of Toyota Motor. The tax credit applies to the 2022 through 2024 Pacifica PHEV minivans. Honda’s 2024 Prologue SUV was the fifth-best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. last quarter, outsold by only Ford’s Mustang Mach-E and a handful of Tesla models. That’s a solid performance for a vehicle launched in March, especially since it’s Honda’s first all-electric SUV. Several automakers are making moves to increase their vehicles’ eligibility for the tax credit. Hyundai Motor Co. (HYMTF) is one of them. The South Korean automaker plans to build a total of six models across its namesake brand, as well as Kia and Genesis, that will qualify for the tax credit through U.S. assembly and battery sourcing operations. It’s building factories in both Ellabell, Georgia, and Bartow County. On Thursday, Hyundai revealed the 2026 Ioniq 9, the first new model set to be made in Ellabell. The three-row electric SUV is expected to qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, according to the company. While those EVs and PHEVs qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, several other models are eligible for a partial credit of about $3.750. That includes Rivian’s (RIVN) R1T electric pickup and R1S electric SUV, as well as Nissan’s (NSANY) Leaf electric compact car. On the hybrid side, Jeep’s Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe, Ford’s Escape, Lincoln’s Corsair Grand Touring, and Audi Q5 vehicles across their respective applying model years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Monday it will not reconsider a landmark rule finalized in April requiring nearly all new cars and trucks by 2029 to have advanced automatic emergency braking systems.  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and other automakers, had said the requirement that all cars and trucks must be able to stop and avoid striking vehicles in front of them at up to 62 miles per hour (100 kph) is \"practically impossible with available technology\" and had asked the agency to reconsider it.

(Bloomberg) -- China’s Hesai Group, the world’s largest maker of lidar sensors used in driver assistance systems, is on a growth trajectory that won’t be stopped by geopolitics, according to Chief Executive Officer David Li.

Shipments more than doubled from a year earlier, and Li said that growth will continue, with deliveries expected to rise to 1 million units in 2025. Founded in 2014, Hesai has grown rapidly to become the world’s largest supplier of lidars — short for light detection and ranging — a remote sensing technology that helps vehicles navigate their surroundings. The company commands about 37% of the global market and listed on the Nasdaq in 2023. “Lidar is like the eyes of the autonomous vehicle,” Li said in interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “It’s a life-saving device.” Hesai is poised to benefit even more from the fast development of advanced driving-assistance systems, a technology that Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers see as the future of mobility. While Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has repeatedly dismissed lidar technology in preference of real-time cameras and AI, many in the auto industry see lidar as improving the safety of autonomous cars. For example, Li said, the sensors can scan the road for problems and activate a car’s brakes or airbags before a driver is even aware of an issue. “It’s enormously important to bring such technology to every vehicle on the road to save lives,” he said. While true autonomous driving may take years, if not longer, to achieve, Li said he sees adoption starting from confined areas such as ports and expanding quickly from there. Separately, in an interview with Reuters, Li said Hesai plans to reduce the price of its key product by half next year. This will take the next-generation ATX lidar down to below $200, half the price of the current model. Li also hit back at a US decision to place Hesai on a Chinese Military Company blacklist — which names companies the Department of Defense alleges have contributed to civilian military efforts by the People’s Liberation Army — a move which has weighed on the shares. Hesai was added to the list in January, briefly removed in August and then reinstated in October. The company has started legal action against the Pentagon, Li said in the interview. “We have zero connection to the Chinese military,” Li said. “We believe we were wrongly added to this list,” he added, saying the sensors have no capability to transfer data. “It is scanning the road, but there’s no way it should be a concern for national security, data security or even privacy in the sense that it doesn’t capture facial features.” --With assistance from Huiao Cui and Joanne Wong.

                "title": "After fast start, electric cars need a recharge as range limits, cost leave some drivers skeptical",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. DETROIT (AP) — While sales of electric vehicles surge in China, adoption of more environmentally friendly vehicles is stumbling in the United States and Europe as carmakers and governments struggle to meet years-old promises about affordability and charging stations. Adding to those headwinds: an incoming new U.S. president who has disparaged government support for electric vehicles. China is the exception. Driven by government subsidies and mandates, vehicles with electric motors, including plug-in hybrids that combine electric and fossil fuel motors, topped 50% of sales in the month of July. Concerns about range, charging infrastructure and higher prices are sore points among both electric car enthusiasts and skeptics in Europe and the U.S. Solar panels power charging at Detlef Mueller-Salis' home in Mainz, Germany, so he thought he was all set to go electric. But range concerns, charging times and confusing charging payment methods have proved frustrating. So after four years, he and his wife sold their Porsche Taycan and Fiat 500 electrics and bought a BMW 5-Series and a Volkswagen Polo, both internal combustion. The smaller Fiat could run 220 kilometers (136.70 miles) on a charge in summer and 180 in winter, he said, against the manufacturer's specification of 320 kilometers. Constantly checking the battery before quick trips to visit grandchildren and elder parents grew annoying. So did going on vacation with payment cards from five different charging plans. The Porsche took 30 minutes to charge instead of the 22 minutes advertised, not a huge difference but “not what the company promised,” said Mueller-Salis, who is retired from a logistics company. Driving fast on the autobahn reduced range so that “you paid for it with charging time.” Both retirees in their 70s, Ken and Roxanne Honeycutt mainly drive their used Kia Soul around their town near Oakland, California. They charge the EV, with a range of about 111 miles (179 kilometers), in their garage and don't rely much on public infrastructure. But for longer trips they have to plan fast charging stops ahead of time. “We wanted to try it,” Roxanne said of the EV. “Sometimes we found that the charging stations don’t always work, they’re broken down, so that gives you a little bit of anxiety if you know okay, I need to charge.” On one cold, rainy January day, the Soul’s range dropped faster than expected, so they had to stop twice to charge. Another time, they hit multiple non-functioning chargers — even in California, where EV adoption leads the rest of the country. Their range dropped to 13 miles. “We’re used to having a gas station on every corner, 24 hours a day,” Roxanne said, adding they still like the vehicle. Electric cars aren’t going away. They are essential for planet-warming carbon emissions reductions governments agreed to under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Electrified vehicle sales will reach 17 million this year, or one car in five sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency. That includes plug-in hybrids that combine electric with internal combustion motors. But about 60% of those sales are in China. In Europe, sales of electric-only cars fell 5.8% in January-September from a year earlier, while their market share fell to 13% from 14%. Pure EVs accounted for 8% of overall U.S. vehicle sales in October. So, the market is growing, but sales have slowed. They're not plunging, but they're not yet growing fast enough to meet climate goals. Aside from buyer hesitancy, barriers remain Higher prices matter. A Volkswagen ID. 3 hatchback costs 39,995 euros (about $42,090), compared to the similar-sized Volkswagen Golf fuel engine version at 27,180 euros ($29,136), according to the ADAC auto association. U.S. EV prices have fallen significantly since 2022, but the average price in October for a new one, $56,902, still exceeded the average $48,623 for a new vehicle. Cost remains an issue for the more mainstream American consumers EV makers hope to target, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. Uncertainty over purchase subsidies also complicates price comparisons. EV sales plunged in Germany early this year after the government abruptly cancelled the purchase premium of 6,750 euros for cars up to 40,000 euros and 4,500 euros for cars up to 65,000 euros. ADAC says that means most internal combustion models are a better deal over a car's lifetime. Conservative political parties and the industry are now questioning the EU’s goal of eliminating most fuel engine vehicles by 2035, a decision that’s up for review in 2026. The European Auto Manufacturers’ Association is urging that carbon dioxide limits which carmakers must meet by 2026 or face heavy fines be relaxed. Some carmakers have pushed back electrification plans. President-elect Trump has vowed to end what he called the Biden administration’s EV “mandate,” though he has softened his anti-EV stance as his ties with Tesla CEO Elon Musk grew closer. Automakers are not required to sell EVs under the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas emissions standards regulating tailpipe pollution, though they need EV sales to be at least 56% of their total sales to meet ambitious standards for cutting emissions. Trump may also eliminate critical EV tax credits. Even if fewer buyers choose EVs, tax credits or not, auto companies show no intention of fully retreating from the transition away from gas-burning cars and trucks. The China difference China's auto market, the world's largest has been transformed by billions of dollars in subsidies, with EV sales reaching 25.8% of the 13.5 million vehicles sold in January-August, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The government is encouraging car buyers to go electric, and many are buying EVs or plug-in hybrids under an economic stimulus program. The phasing out of earlier subsidies in 2022 unleashed a fierce price war, toppling some weaker automakers. Some Chinese EVs sell for less than $20,000 in their home market. The government push encouraged many start-ups that took the Tesla model and ran with it. They simplified car designs to cut costs and filled interiors with gadgetry appealing to a smartphone-savvy generation. Photographer Wu Cong sat inside his $23,000 Hongqi E-QM5 as it recharged in Beijing. He travels often for work, racking up 80,000 kilometers (50,000 miles) in the last two years. The EV saves him about 50 yuan ($7) in fuel costs for every 100 kilometers, he said, which would add up to $5,600 over two years. The sedan's navigation system reminds him to recharge after driving a distance of his choosing. “It will tell you if there are charging stations ahead and if anyone is using them,” he said. Beijing tech worker Shang Wenting said her family hardly uses their gasoline-powered car anymore except for on long trips, preferring a sapphire Tesla Model Y they bought for about $37,000. During a weekly trip to a charging station 10 minutes from her home, Shang said the Tesla is cheaper to drive and she loves its “smart features,” like an energy recovery system that means she can press on the accelerator less. “It feels like switching from an old phone to a smart phone,” she said. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Chicago, IL – November 27, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia’s NVDA, Coinbase COIN, Tesla TSLA and Astera Labs ALAB. Year-to-date, Wall Street is enjoying one of its best presidential election years ever, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 26% in 2024. Per usual, the move seems more obvious than in hindsight than it was in real-time. For example, multiple geopolitical conflicts are occurring in Europe and the Middle East, interest rates remain at elevated levels, and many investors are concerned about valuations and wonder how much fuel the artificial intelligence buildout has left in the tank. That said, there are several reasons to remain bullish equities into year-end, including: Historical seasonality trends have been a fantastic guide for investors. Though trading volumes tend to dip into the Thanksgiving holiday, stocks historically tend to grind higher into the end of November. Meanwhile, Ryan Detrick of Carson Research points out that, “No month is more likely to be higher than December in an election year.” Using data going back to 1950, the month of December is higher 83% of the time during presidential election years. A common bearish argument amongst Wall Street investors has been that there is a lack of broad participation, or breadth, in the market. However, the slim participation argument has been flipped on its head recently. For example, the Russell 2000 Index ETF is up more than 12% in November and is finally approaching its all-time highs from 2021. Business spending on AI surged 500% this year to $13.8 billion, according to Menlo Ventures. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that the future may even be brighter. Analysts anticipate that Nvidia’s earnings growth will balloon to 123.08% year-over-year. Institutional investors often look to get winning stocks “on their books” and “window dress” their portfolios to make them look better when they send out year-end statements to clients. As a result, institutional investors may drive up 2024 winners like Coinbase, Tesla and Astera Labs. TheNasdaq 100 ETF is on the verge of breaking out of a three-month base structure. Bottom Line Despite the stellar performance thus far in U.S. equities, several data points suggest that its not too late to get long stocks for an end of year rally. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.

Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), the EV startup that rivals Tesla, offers a bag of potential catalysts that drive the stock price higher. Here are a few key points: The Conditional Loan up to $6.6 billion The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offers a conditional loan to support the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. The conditional loan is actually part of the Advanced Technology VehiclesManufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program and worths up to $6.6 billion. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with RIVN. As an automaker specializes in electric vehicle, Rivian planned to expand its production facility in Georgia. The expansion plan was then welcomed by the conditional loan offered by the DOE up to $6.6 billion. The loan is expected bolster Rivian's production as much as 400,000 units annually and create more than 7,500 operational jobs and 2,000 construction jobs by 2030 while strengthening the EV ecosystem in the U.S. The loan offer is a positive development for the company and investors buy the sentiment positively today. Volkswagen's Capital Influx Before the loan offer, Volkswagen as Rivian's joint venture is already planned to increase its investment to $5.8 billion to integrate Rivian's EV software-defined vehicle technology into Volkswagen's future electric vehicles. As part of the joint venture agreement, Rivian already pocketed $1 billion convertible note from Volkswagen and Rivian will begin to construct its R2 model next year and plan to build the R3 model beyond that. Tesla's Legal Suit Has Come to An End Back in 2020 Tesla filed a lawsuit against Rivian, the EV automaker giant accused Rivian steal its battery technology secret from Tesla's former employees. After a lengthy legal battle, Tesla agreed to dismiss the case by December 24, 2024, as conditional settlement terms are met. The details are not disclosed but it is likely proven that Rivian did not misuse any proprietary technology. California's Rebate Program on EV Purchase Incentive California where Rivian is headquartered just announced the plan to revive the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program (CVRP). It's a rebate program to incentivize the purchase of electric vehicle (EVs) by reducing the purchase price of EVs to encourage more people to go for zero-emission vehicles. The incentive may increase the demand for Rivian's EV and boost the confidence of its investors to go bullish on Rivian. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

The world has seen three industrial revolutions, each defined by widespread adoption of new technologies: The first was instigated by steam-powered machines, the second by electricity and telephones, and the third by microprocessors and the internet. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says artificial intelligence is the fourth industrial revolution. Given how profoundly the first three industrial revolutions changed the world, it is no stretch to say the artificial intelligence boom is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors. And Wall Street analysts are broadly bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), as detailed below. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Among the 67 analyst that follow Alphabet, the median target price is $210 per share. That implies 25% upside from its current share price of $168. Importantly, even the lowest target of $185 per share implies 10% upside. Among the 40 analysts that follow Pinterest, the median target price is $40 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $30. Importantly, even the lowest target of $31 per share implies 3% upside. I mentioned that even the lowest price targets on Alphabet and Pinterest imply upside for shareholders, but there is always risk where the stock market is concerned, so positive returns are never guaranteed. However, it's fair to say most Wall Street analysts view Alphabet and Pinterest as screaming buys. Alphabet is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth across its core advertising and cloud computing businesses. The company already has a strong presence in both markets: It is the largest digital advertiser and third-largest public cloud worldwide. But new AI products could further strengthen its positioning and boost growth. For instance, Alphabet has introduced generative AI overviews in Google Search, and CEO Sundar Pichai says engagement and satisfaction are trending higher. Investment bank Evercore recently conducted a survey that came to the same conclusion, but went one step further in speculating that AI overviews are also generating higher quality leads for advertisers. If true, that could let Alphabet charge more for its ad tech services. In cloud computing, Forrester Research ranks Google as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions, foundational large language models, and machine learning platforms. Also, principle analyst Mike Gualtieri wrote, \"Google is the best positioned hyperscaler for AI.\" Indeed, the company gained two percentage points of market share over the past year, while Amazon and Microsoft both lost share. As a caveat, a federal judge in August ruled Alphabet had engaged in illegal activities to protect its internet search monopoly, and the Justice Department has since recommended that the company be forced to sell its Chrome browser. What promises to be a lengthy appeals process means a resolution may be years away, but certain legal experts have told CNBC the judge will likely impose a less severe remedy. Importantly, history suggests a breakup of the core advertising and cloud computing businesses is highly unlikely. The Justice Department has not successfully broken up a company in 40 years, and the last time a judge attempted to break up a big tech company -- Microsoft in 2000 -- a federal appeals court subsequently reversed the decision. That antitrust issue is weighing on market sentiment right now, but that may change when Alphabet responds with its own proposed remedy on Dec. 20. Regardless, Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.3 times earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a position today. Pinterest is a somewhat unique social media platform in that it prioritizes inspiration over communication. The company considers artificial intelligence a core competency. For instance, machine learning models informed by searches, saves, and clicks generate over 400 million predictions per second to surface relevant content for users. Indeed, CEO Bill Ready recently told analysts that virtually \"all content served on Pinterest, including organic and ads, is powered by AI recommendation models.\" However, the company is also leaning on AI to improve campaign performance for advertisers. Its new Performance+ product bundles AI tools for content generation, budgeting, bidding, and targeting. Management says Performance+ lets brands construct advertising campaigns with half as many inputs. It also reduces cost per action by 10%, meaning brands can achieve the desired outcome while spending a little less money. Performance+ entered general availability in October, and Bill Ready says the company is pleased with the early demand signals from advertisers. Pinterest has another key catalyst in its partnerships with Amazon and Google, which bring demand from third-party advertisers to its platform. The company began collaborating with Amazon in the U.S. last year and recently expanded the relationship to Canada and Mexico. And Pinterest started collaborating with Google earlier this year in previously unmonetized and under-monetized international markets. CEO Bill Ready on the third-quarter earnings call said, \"Both of these partnerships have continued to build sequentially throughout the year, and we expect that trajectory to persist into Q4.\" Importantly, Amazon and Google are two of the three largest ad tech companies in the world, so they represent potentially meaningful sources of demand. That could lead to accelerated earnings growth for Pinterest. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Pinterest's adjusted earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 21.1 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Investors should feel comfortable buying a position in this AI stock today.

For those interested in viewing the Thematic lists, please click here >>> Thematic Screens – Zacks Investment Research. Let’s take a closer look at the ‘Nuclear’ theme and analyze a few stocks that the screen returned, such as Constellation Energy CEG and Vistra VST. Nuclear Overview Nuclear energy stands at the cusp of the global push for a low-carbon, greener, and more resilient energy future. This investment theme encapsulates companies engaged in uranium mining, nuclear reactor construction and maintenance, and the generation of electricity from nuclear sources, alongside firms providing essential technology and services to the nuclear industry. Constellation Energy found itself in the spotlight following news earlier in the year that it’d be restarting a nuclear plant in a deal with mega-cap technology giant Microsoft. Microsoft will purchase power from the plant to meet its data center needs, a theme we’ve all become familiar with amid the AI frenzy. Up 130% YTD, CEG shares have delivered a remarkable performance relative to the S&P 500’s 27% gain. The outlook for its current fiscal year remains constructive, with the $8.14 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 21% over the last year and suggesting 60% growth year-over-year. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Vistra safely operates a reliable, efficient power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot in 2024, gaining nearly 320% and widely outperforming. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Vistra closed an acquisition of Energy Harbor earlier in 2024, which added more than 4,000 MW of nuclear generation to its portfolio alongside roughly one million retail customers. Further, the company also inked two new power purchase agreements with both Amazon and Microsoft, adding to its already favorable stance. Shares could also attract income-focused investors, with its current 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate reflective of a shareholder-friendly nature. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s quarterly payouts.

Microsoft said most Outlook and Teams services had been restored as of Monday evening, after more than 24 hours of technical delays. On Tuesday afternoon, the company announced a full restoration of services. At the outage’s peak, tracking site Downdetector showed more than 5,000 user-reported problems, though this data doesn’t fully reflect the scale. “We’ve restored functionality for all impacted services except Outlook on the web, which is still affected for a small number of users,” Microsoft wrote in a post on X shortly before 11:00 p.m. ET. “We’re monitoring and troubleshooting to fully recover.” By Monday afternoon, the company said it had seen some recovery after it deployed a fix to the problem, and reports of outages on Downdetector had dropped sharply. Around 7:30 p.m. ET, the tech giant estimated the issue would be resolved in three hours. Around noon, the company said the fix had reached “approximately 98% of the affected environments,” though reports on Downdetector kept increasing. It can take time for updates to work their way to customers’ systems. However, Microsoft then noted those restarts were “progressing slower than anticipated for the majority of affected users” and did not yet provide an estimated time for a fix. At 2 p.m. ET, the company said it was still facing delays in its recovery. The outage has hindered many office workers — though some US users on X celebrated the small break ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Tech outages have had dire effects around the world this year, though Microsoft’s case isn’t as widespread in comparison. In what’s been called the largest IT outage in history, CrowdStrike’s software issue over the summer halted air travel, disrupted hospitals and cost Fortune 500 companies more than $5 billion in direct losses.

Very few companies have come to dominate their respective industries with a massive user base and tremendous success quite like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). And the business has won over investors. Its shares have catapulted 10,130% higher in the past couple of decades, although they've taken a breather, recently down 8% from their all-time peak (as of Nov. 22). Amazon has a gargantuan $2.1 trillion market cap, so you might be wondering if this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is still a good opportunity. Here are three reasons to consider buying Amazon like there's no tomorrow. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » When a business has an economic moat, it's a sign of a high-quality enterprise that can defend itself from competition. Amazon has multiple competitive strengths that have supported its success. The online marketplace -- which brings together shoppers, merchants, and advertisers -- becomes more valuable to all stakeholders as it expands. This creates network effects. Amazon operates a colossal logistics network after years of heavy investment to bolster its supply-chain capabilities. This gives the business cost advantages when shipping products to consumers. All of the various product and service lines Amazon offers means that it has virtually unlimited touch points with its customers. Consequently, Amazon has an unrivaled ability to constantly collect treasure troves of data that can inform strategic decisions. If you're a long-term investor who aims to buy and hold stocks for several years, it's critical to focus on companies that possess a moat. This means the business has staying power and the ability to successfully fend off rivals and new industry entrants, protecting itself from the ongoing threat of disruption. Amazon excels in this regard. The leadership team has positioned the company well to thrive over the long haul, just as it has done in the past. Investing in companies that gain from powerful secular trends is a worthwhile strategy, but it's not often you can find a business that is riding multiple trends at the same time. This is precisely what Amazon is doing. Everybody knows that this company is the king of the e-commerce sector. A whopping 38% of online sales in the U.S. happen on amazon.com. That's a monster lead that puts the company in an advantageous position to capture a sizable chunk of the growth of the e-commerce industry's sales. It's difficult for anyone to compete with Amazon's fast and free shipping on millions of items. And with the recent launch of Amazon Haul, the company is further strengthening its position to cater to value-conscious shoppers and their needs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in the global cloud computing market and has typically been the key growth and profit driver for the overall business. According to Grand View Research, the cloud market is expected to grow about 21% annually between now and 2030, eventually becoming a $2.4 trillion industry. This means that there's still a huge migration left to happen for companies of all sizes to shift their IT spending from on-site to off-premises. AWS is undoubtedly in a wonderful position to continue growing rapidly through the rest of the decade. Amazon is not only one of the world's largest companies, but it's also one of the best-performing stocks ever. However, the current valuation still looks reasonable. The price-to-sales ratio of 3.4 is in line with the trailing-10-year average. The shares trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of 42.2. That doesn't look like a bargain, but consider that Amazon's diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 94% year over year in the first nine months of 2024. And Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for EPS to rise at a compound annual rate of more than 21% between 2024 and 2026. Given the impressive bottom-line trajectory, the valuation is justified. This is another reason to scoop up the stock. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Should Not Ignore. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you should not ignore. Large language models power AI chatbots and they are the hottest items on Wall Street these days. Several hyperscalers have launched their own LLMs and chatbots in the past few months. Any updates related to these chatbots are followed eagerly by analysts. Anthropic, an AI startup that developed the Claude AI model, recently proposed a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the data that powers them. The startup claims that the system, called the Model Context Protocol, which is open source, would help AI models produce better and more relevant responses to queries. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

You can break stock investing into two different styles: growth and value. Growth stocks have outperformed lately as the S&P 500 Growth index returned 37.9% over the last year through Nov. 22. That's about 10.9 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 Value index. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Naturally, you'll want to pick a company that can sustain the momentum. Fortunately, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) still has strong growth potential. That may surprise some, given how fast the company's sales have grown since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO). Annual sales went from about $148 million to $470 billion during this period. While sales likely won't grow at that breakneck pace, Amazon remains my top growth stock. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been growing sales at a rapid clip for some time. That seems set to continue for the foreseeable future. Growth may accelerate as companies and organizations continue rapidly adopting artificial intelligence (AI). AWS is Amazon's cloud-computing business that offers various services from its data centers. Organizations have increasingly been using data to make key decisions, and that seems set to continue as they keep using machine learning and AI. The unit's sales grew more than 19% to $27.5 billion. With the highest operating margin out of Amazon's three segments, it remains a key profit driver. AWS' operating income increased nearly 50% to $10.4 billion and accounted for 60% of Amazon's total operating profit. Since these centers require large amounts of space and energy, AWS' large size remains a competitive advantage. AWS has a market-share lead of 31%, in this fast-growing area. That's followed by Microsoft's Azure (20% share) and Alphabet's 12% share. Several smaller competitors have less than 5% of the market. Amazon's other two segments, North America and international, encompass wide-ranging businesses. These include its online and physical retail operations, subscription services like Prime, and advertising. These have been performing well, albeit at a lower profit margin than AWS. North America's third-quarter sales grew 9% to $95.5 billion, and International's sales increased 12% to $35.9 billion. Within these divisions, advertising and subscription services stand out. The mountains of data that Amazon collects is a gold mine for advertisers. Advertising services continues to experience rapid sales growth, including 19% in the latest quarter. Subscription sales, which include the popular Prime service, grew its top line 11% during this period. Over the last five years through Nov. 22, Amazon's stock has gained 125.8%, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 91.9% appreciation. The company's success isn't lost on investors, which is why Amazon's stock trades at a premium valuation. The shares have a 42 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). That compares to the S&P 500's 31 P/E multiple. But this valuation isn't based merely on the company's past performance. With a leading market position in a fast-growing segment, Amazon's highly profitable AWS business should continue leading the way. And investors shouldn't forget about the company's other businesses. Although these businesses are less profitable, people still subscribe to Prime and order online for the convenience, fast delivery, and low prices. As a result, I think it's worth paying a higher price for a quality growth company. And you can start with a modest sum, like $3,000, which you can add to regularly over time. That way, you'll build a tidy sum as your investment appreciates.

                "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Screaming Buys, According to Wall Street",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The world has seen three industrial revolutions, each defined by widespread adoption of new technologies: The first was instigated by steam-powered machines, the second by electricity and telephones, and the third by microprocessors and the internet. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says artificial intelligence is the fourth industrial revolution. Given how profoundly the first three industrial revolutions changed the world, it is no stretch to say the artificial intelligence boom is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors. And Wall Street analysts are broadly bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), as detailed below. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Among the 67 analyst that follow Alphabet, the median target price is $210 per share. That implies 25% upside from its current share price of $168. Importantly, even the lowest target of $185 per share implies 10% upside. Among the 40 analysts that follow Pinterest, the median target price is $40 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $30. Importantly, even the lowest target of $31 per share implies 3% upside. I mentioned that even the lowest price targets on Alphabet and Pinterest imply upside for shareholders, but there is always risk where the stock market is concerned, so positive returns are never guaranteed. However, it's fair to say most Wall Street analysts view Alphabet and Pinterest as screaming buys. Alphabet is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth across its core advertising and cloud computing businesses. The company already has a strong presence in both markets: It is the largest digital advertiser and third-largest public cloud worldwide. But new AI products could further strengthen its positioning and boost growth. For instance, Alphabet has introduced generative AI overviews in Google Search, and CEO Sundar Pichai says engagement and satisfaction are trending higher. Investment bank Evercore recently conducted a survey that came to the same conclusion, but went one step further in speculating that AI overviews are also generating higher quality leads for advertisers. If true, that could let Alphabet charge more for its ad tech services. In cloud computing, Forrester Research ranks Google as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions, foundational large language models, and machine learning platforms. Also, principle analyst Mike Gualtieri wrote, \"Google is the best positioned hyperscaler for AI.\" Indeed, the company gained two percentage points of market share over the past year, while Amazon and Microsoft both lost share. As a caveat, a federal judge in August ruled Alphabet had engaged in illegal activities to protect its internet search monopoly, and the Justice Department has since recommended that the company be forced to sell its Chrome browser. What promises to be a lengthy appeals process means a resolution may be years away, but certain legal experts have told CNBC the judge will likely impose a less severe remedy. Importantly, history suggests a breakup of the core advertising and cloud computing businesses is highly unlikely. The Justice Department has not successfully broken up a company in 40 years, and the last time a judge attempted to break up a big tech company -- Microsoft in 2000 -- a federal appeals court subsequently reversed the decision. That antitrust issue is weighing on market sentiment right now, but that may change when Alphabet responds with its own proposed remedy on Dec. 20. Regardless, Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.3 times earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a position today. Pinterest is a somewhat unique social media platform in that it prioritizes inspiration over communication. The company considers artificial intelligence a core competency. For instance, machine learning models informed by searches, saves, and clicks generate over 400 million predictions per second to surface relevant content for users. Indeed, CEO Bill Ready recently told analysts that virtually \"all content served on Pinterest, including organic and ads, is powered by AI recommendation models.\" However, the company is also leaning on AI to improve campaign performance for advertisers. Its new Performance+ product bundles AI tools for content generation, budgeting, bidding, and targeting. Management says Performance+ lets brands construct advertising campaigns with half as many inputs. It also reduces cost per action by 10%, meaning brands can achieve the desired outcome while spending a little less money. Performance+ entered general availability in October, and Bill Ready says the company is pleased with the early demand signals from advertisers. Pinterest has another key catalyst in its partnerships with Amazon and Google, which bring demand from third-party advertisers to its platform. The company began collaborating with Amazon in the U.S. last year and recently expanded the relationship to Canada and Mexico. And Pinterest started collaborating with Google earlier this year in previously unmonetized and under-monetized international markets. CEO Bill Ready on the third-quarter earnings call said, \"Both of these partnerships have continued to build sequentially throughout the year, and we expect that trajectory to persist into Q4.\" Importantly, Amazon and Google are two of the three largest ad tech companies in the world, so they represent potentially meaningful sources of demand. That could lead to accelerated earnings growth for Pinterest. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Pinterest's adjusted earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 21.1 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Investors should feel comfortable buying a position in this AI stock today.

Shares in Dell slid 11% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, after the computer and software manufacturer posted third quarter results that missed revenue estimates. Revenue came in at $24.37bn (£19.32bn), which was below consensus expectations of $24.59bn. However, Dell reported record third-quarter revenue from its infrastructure solutions group business, rising 34% to $11.4bn. Server and networking revenue was up 58% to $7.4bn, noting demand growth across AI and traditional servers. Dell's AI-optimised servers are powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) chips.

In addition, they said that its consumer business was also softer than expected. Revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter of between $24bn and $25bn also appeared to disappoint against average estimates of $25.57bn, according to Reuters. Fellow computer maker HP also tumbled into the red in after hours trading, after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results in line with analyst estimates.

These have ranged over the years from the possibility of strike actions to conflicts and volcanic ash clouds, let alone the major shock which the pandemic brought.\" \"Indeed, the EasyJet share price remains some 52% shy of pre-pandemic levels, indicating how much damage can be done by exogenous events and how difficult the recovery path can be,\" he said. However, Hunter added: \"The general view towards the company is also undiminished, with the market consensus of the shares as a buy on optimism for the longer term still firmly intact.\" EasyJet shares were up nearly 2% on Wednesday morning, with the stock up 7.5% year-to-date. Online food delivery platform Just Eat announced on Wednesday morning that it planned to delist its shares from the London Stock Exchange, effective from the morning of 27 December 2024. Just Eat said it made the decision in order to \"reduce the administrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\". Following the delisting in London, the company said it would maintain its primary listing of its shares on the Euronext Amsterdam market. Just Eat's London-listed shares were down 1.4%, while its Amsterdam-listed shares were less than 1% in the red.

The changes, which came into effect later in July, included the elimination of the \"premium\" and \"standard\" listing segments, replaced by a single category called commercial companies. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"The changes are more beneficial to companies that are only listed in London and which previously didn’t qualify for the FTSE indices under the old rules because they had chosen a tier-two category for various reasons such as looser regulation.\" “If anything, we’re likely to see more companies in Just Eat’s situation think hard about the need to have secondary listings in London if their primary listing on another exchange is functioning well and they are looking for ways to cut costs,\" he added. \"If trading is thin in London, it’s hard to justify the costs of retaining the listing.\" Aston Martin (AML.L) Johnson Matthey (JMAT.L) Pennon (PNN.L) Pets At Home (PETS.L) Read more: Is Black Friday the best time to buy tech products?

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia slipped as traders digested Donald Trump’s latest cabinet appointments, a day after his tariff threats roiled emerging markets. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was down 0.2%, with benchmarks falling about 1% in Japan while those in Hong Kong and China gained. Equity futures in Europe also drifted lower. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar retreated 0.1% to pare some of its strength in the previous session. The yen gained. The president elect’s tariffs agenda seemed to gather further momentum on Wednesday, as Trump named Jamieson Greer as the US Trade Representative and Kevin Hassett to direct the National Economic Council. Greer was intimately involved in Trump’s first-term trade policy decisions. A slew of data from the US due later on inflation and economic growth may provide clues to the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. “Prospects of further US tariffs remain a worry for Asian markets,” said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The appointment of Greer to USTR is largely in line with expectations, indicating a more restrictive trade stance by the US under the Trump administration. It is clear that ‘Trump means business’ when it comes to tariffs.” New Zealand lowered the official cash rate by 50 basis points. The local dollar advanced as traders parsed the central bank’s rate projections and governor’s comments. The yen strengthened as much as 0.6% against the dollar. US 10-year yields fell one basis points to 4.29%, after gaining three basis points in the previous session. Fed officials indicated support for a careful approach to rate cuts, according to minutes from their latest policy meeting. Back in Asia, China is in focus as the government has approved a bond quota totaling 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) that will allow two state-owned asset managers to issue notes to fund investments in projects aimed at boosting economic growth. In corporate news, Vitasoy International Holdings Ltd. shares surged the most since its listing after one of its shareholders raised stake in the soy food producer. Sanrio Co. tumbled the most in a decade after the brand owner of Hello Kitty said holders including its president will sell shares.

You can break stock investing into two different styles: growth and value. Growth stocks have outperformed lately as the S&P 500 Growth index returned 37.9% over the last year through Nov. 22. That's about 10.9 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 Value index. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Naturally, you'll want to pick a company that can sustain the momentum. Fortunately, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) still has strong growth potential. That may surprise some, given how fast the company's sales have grown since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO). Annual sales went from about $148 million to $470 billion during this period. While sales likely won't grow at that breakneck pace, Amazon remains my top growth stock. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been growing sales at a rapid clip for some time. That seems set to continue for the foreseeable future. Growth may accelerate as companies and organizations continue rapidly adopting artificial intelligence (AI). AWS is Amazon's cloud-computing business that offers various services from its data centers. Organizations have increasingly been using data to make key decisions, and that seems set to continue as they keep using machine learning and AI. The unit's sales grew more than 19% to $27.5 billion. With the highest operating margin out of Amazon's three segments, it remains a key profit driver. AWS' operating income increased nearly 50% to $10.4 billion and accounted for 60% of Amazon's total operating profit. Since these centers require large amounts of space and energy, AWS' large size remains a competitive advantage. AWS has a market-share lead of 31%, in this fast-growing area. That's followed by Microsoft's Azure (20% share) and Alphabet's 12% share. Several smaller competitors have less than 5% of the market. Amazon's other two segments, North America and international, encompass wide-ranging businesses. These include its online and physical retail operations, subscription services like Prime, and advertising. These have been performing well, albeit at a lower profit margin than AWS. North America's third-quarter sales grew 9% to $95.5 billion, and International's sales increased 12% to $35.9 billion. Within these divisions, advertising and subscription services stand out. The mountains of data that Amazon collects is a gold mine for advertisers. Advertising services continues to experience rapid sales growth, including 19% in the latest quarter. Subscription sales, which include the popular Prime service, grew its top line 11% during this period. Over the last five years through Nov. 22, Amazon's stock has gained 125.8%, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 91.9% appreciation. The company's success isn't lost on investors, which is why Amazon's stock trades at a premium valuation. The shares have a 42 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). That compares to the S&P 500's 31 P/E multiple. But this valuation isn't based merely on the company's past performance. With a leading market position in a fast-growing segment, Amazon's highly profitable AWS business should continue leading the way. And investors shouldn't forget about the company's other businesses. Although these businesses are less profitable, people still subscribe to Prime and order online for the convenience, fast delivery, and low prices. As a result, I think it's worth paying a higher price for a quality growth company. And you can start with a modest sum, like $3,000, which you can add to regularly over time. That way, you'll build a tidy sum as your investment appreciates.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and European stocks were lower on Wednesday morning as traders awaited the latest data on US inflation and weighed up the threat of tariffs from Donald Trump. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which will be released this afternoon, is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation in the American economy. Meanwhile, Trump rattled the financial markets on Tuesday by announcing he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and an extra 10% on China, in a crackdown on immigration and drugs. But overnight, Wall Street climbed to fresh record highs. The gains came in a session when minutes of the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed confidence that inflation is on track for the bank’s 2% target. Economists at Deutsche Bank have calculated that if Trump’s threatened tariffs were fully implemented, US core PCE inflation for 2025 could increase from 2.6% to 3.7%. Before Trump’s victory the assumption was for 2.3% inflation in 2025. London’s benchmark index was treading water in early trade. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) dipped 0.4% and the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris headed 1.2% into the red, to its lowest level since early August. The pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) was up 0.4%. Wall Street is set for a negative start as S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the red. The pound was 0.2% up against the US dollar (GBPUSD=X) at 1.2599.

Before Trump’s victory the assumption was for 2.3% inflation in 2025. Clare Lombardelli, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, also warned that the proposed trade tariff would pose a risk to economic growth in countries including the UK. She said: Shares were mixed in Asia overnight with the Nikkei (^N225) down 0.8% on the day in Japan, as the Japanese yen surged in value against the US dollar, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) soared 2.3% in Hong Kong. The dollar fell to 152.31 yen from 153.08 yen. It had traded above 155 yen recently, but uncertainty over the future course of US trade policy has led investors to buy yen as a safe haven, analysts said. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was 1.5% higher by the end of the session. Across the pond, US stocks rose to record highs despite Donald Trump’s latest talk about tariffs, which caused only ripples on Wall Street. The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.3% to 44,860.31; the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also advanced 0.6% to 6,021.63, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.6% to 19,174.30.

(Bloomberg) -- A rally in bank stocks since the end of September could force the largest US institutions to further pull back activity in the market for repurchase agreements or foreign exchange derivatives, according to Deutsche Bank. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Banks’ share prices are used to calculate a part of the regulatory scores for the global systematically important bank (GSIB), which are taken at the end of the year to determine their surcharge, or amount of capital banks need to maintain on their balance sheets. The higher the score the more cash banks are required to hold. Banks tend to pare derivatives and repo market activities in order to lower potential scores before year-end. “The pressure to reduce year-end activities would likely be most acute for banks whose GSIB indicators grew during the year, putting them at risk of a higher surcharge for future years,” strategists that include Steven Zeng wrote in a note published Friday. For the five GSIBs with significant prime brokerage businesses, their scores are at risk of rising between 2.5 and 6.6 points, based on their share price as of Nov. 21 market close, they said. Deutsche Bank estimates those GSIBs would need to reduce their repo activity by $95 billion or foreign exchange activity by $290 billion to fully offset the impact of their stock price appreciation on their score. The rate on overnight repo for year-end — or loans collateralized by Treasuries — and those backed by mortgage-backed securities soared in recent weeks. Some of this is due to a surge in repo levels on Sept. 30 that stemmed more from primary dealers’ balance-sheet congestion than the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening. At the same time, a recent surge in equities has increased demand for repo collateralized by stocks, further adding to funding constraints. Wall Street is preparing for even more volatility on the final trading day of 2024. More than half of the eight GSIBs could be pressured, according to Deutsche Bank, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America already facing the highest surcharges, based on their estimated third quarter scores. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are near the top of the upper threshold in their respective buckets. BofA, Citi, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Goldman did not provide comment before publication. JPMorgan’s estimated GSIB score has already jumped 160 points since last year in the third quarter, placing it in the top surcharge bucket of 5.5% if the score is maintained at the end of the year. In order to “settle” for a smaller 50 basis point increase, the bank would have to reduce its repo activity by at least $160 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. Last month, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Bloomberg Television acknowledged that the bank “is going to have a trillion dollars of cash and unable to intermediate in Treasury markets or repo markets completely conservatively” because it is required to hold that cash in central bank reserves.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. UPDATE: This article includes comments from Hello Alice. Payment companies are carving out space in providing data analysis to small businesses, an area largely ignored by the big banks and where fintechs are making gains. Micro, small and medium businesses, because of their range of needs and more conservative budgets, pose challenges to data providers. To get payment analysis, these businesses have been turning to fintechs. In fact, while 67% of small businesses look to their retail bank as their primary service provider, more than half supplement their primary bank with one or more fintech offerings, according to research from Arizent, American Banker's publisher. In some cases, small and medium businesses are forced to find a secondary provider because their primary bank doesn't offer the service they require. In addition, about 75% of small businesses use digital tools daily, according to a May 2023 report from Mastercard. A quarter of those businesses say they use six or more digital tools daily. That landscape has paved the way for some of the largest payment companies in the U.S., such as JPMorgan Chase and Mastercard, to put an increased focus on SMBs with the launch of new tools that leverage their respective networks to provide insights to small-business owners. JPMorgan Chase earlier this month launched to its 5 million small-business banking customers a business intelligence tool called Customer Insights, which uses payment data to offer competitive analysis. Chase considers the product \"a game changer\" for its SMB clients, said John Frerichs, managing director and global head of small business payments at JPMorgan Chase. \"We are the largest payment processor by volume in the U.S., so we have a massive amount of data — literally millions of transactions — that we are able to view and then anonymize,\" Frerichs said. Small-business owners that process payments with JPMorgan can see reports from their own data on customer demographics, such as the age of the customer or the zip code they come from, or when to staff to meet high traffic, at no additional cost. For SMBs that don't process payments with the bank, JPMorgan offers a \"look-alike\" model that provides anonymized insights into similar businesses that also serves a key up-selling opportunity for payment processing services, Frerichs said. Cullen Fuller, co-owner of Meredith Jaye and M & Em's boutiques in Chicago, said on a Chase website that \"Customer Insights allows me to map the schedule back to our busy times and has allowed us to shave about 5% off of our labor numbers.\" Fuller said the tool helped save 20% on weekly payroll expenses. Mastercard this month also launched a new SMB insights tool that leans on its vast network to offer a white-label, software-as-a-service business intelligence solution called Biz360 to its platform partners. \"SMBs have been traditionally underserved, in part because they sort of fall between consumers who are the focus of a lot of attention of financial services players and others, and large corporates who kind of qualify for white-glove one-on-one treatment,\" said Jane Prokop, executive vice president of small and medium enterprises at Mastercard. \"Small businesses are sort of in the middle.\" Mastercard is targeting its platform partners that serve small businesses rather than the small businesses themselves, Prokop said. \"There's a wide range of players with whom we have worked in the past and where we're doubling down now in our partnerships with them, because our goal is to provide products to our partners that they can turn around and use to better serve their SMB customers.\" Hello Alice, an educational platform that connects SMBs with grant and lending opportunities and has 1.5 million SMBs registered on its platform, is Mastercard's first customer in North America. Prokop said there are also a wide range of use cases for fintechs, neo-banks, digital wallet providers, payment processors and gateways, credit card issuers and acquirers, and other financial institutions as well as nonbank platform providers to offer the service to their clients. Small businesses on Hello Alice's platform are \"constantly vetting new tools, trying to ensure that one syncs with the other, and juggling the management of multiple interfaces,\" said Carolyn Rodz, CEO and co-founder of Hello Alice. \"Ultimately, SMB's are looking to manage time and discover insights that help them grow. Entrepreneurs have to jump between the various aspects of their businesses to build healthy, solid foundations – and that includes sales, marketing, finance, fundraising, cybersecurity and so much more,\" Rodz said. \"These are the fundamentals of how we assess how healthy their businesses are, and to ensure they're looking broadly at the fundamentals of their businesses because our research shows that when businesses have a strong baseline for growth, they're significantly more likely to sustain operations.\" Biz360 integrates tools that SMBs are already using — such as Quickbooks for bookkeeping — into a single place. It also provides additional insights about their business that SMBs wouldn't be able to see otherwise, Prokop said. There are billing, payment and invoice tools as well as marketing and customer acquisition functionality. \"Everything [SMBs] do is generating data,\" Prokop said. \"Most of the time, though, they can't see it, so [Biz360] is giving them visibility into their own data, which they, by and large, don't have. That helps them understand where they have weak spots, where they're doing well and course correct on how they operate the business.\" Both JPMorgan and Mastercard are responding to an influx of SMB-focused fintech offerings that threaten to continue moving up-market if left unchecked, said Tony DeSanctis, senior director at Cornerstone Advisors. \"I can remember 10 years ago when I was at the last bank I worked at. We never really cracked the nut on how to be successful in what I would call small and micro businesses,\" DeSanctis said. \"The fintechs have done a great job of adding ancillary services and capabilities that make it so that the primary reason you do business with them is not price, not interest rate, it's not fees. \"Unlike consumers, who basically want everything for free, small businesses are willing to pay a premium if it means that you can free them up to do whatever for their businesses instead of the back office.\" Block, Divvy, Ramp and Brex are all examples of fintechs that have been focusing on small and startup-sized businesses, he said. Customer expectations have also changed, DeSanctis said. \"You can go to any bank and get a business checking account. But you can't go to any bank and get the kind of service that a Square is providing, or even some of the tools that the Brexs and the Ramps and some of those other folks are providing, which is why I think you're starting to see recognition by [larger] financial institutions.\" The shift in strategy also makes good on a promise to leverage data that payments companies have been making for years but \"haven't really done a great job fulfilling,\" said Aaron Press, a research director for IDC Insights. Payment companies are \"starting to recognize how this payment data is valuable beyond just the payment use case,\" Press said. \"It really provides a lot of great consumer insights, and bringing it down to the SMB level as a service… is a great way for organizations to differentiate [themselves].\" SMBs also represent higher margin businesses, because they don't get the same volume discounts as larger enterprises, but are harder to serve because of \"sheer numbers\" and varying budgets and business needs, Press said. There were 34.8 million small businesses in the U.S. as of March 2023, according to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy. \"If you get these companies in the fold, you can create and you give them something really valuable, you create sticky, high-margin relationships,\" Press said. JPMorgan and Mastercard are betting that their new solutions will help them stand out from rising fintech competition and be a one-stop shop for business intelligence needs. \"The two things that SMBs don't have in abundance is time and expertise,\" Mastercard's Prokop said. \"They can't be experts in every area or function of the business… there are all these areas in which corporations have very large and dedicated staffs who are quite specialized. \"Small businesses don't have that luxury,\" she said. \"Time is of the essence for them.\" Sign in to access your portfolio",

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Stefania Spezzati and Libby George LONDON (Reuters) -The world's top investment banks are on track to post the highest revenue in five years from trading Israel's bonds and currency thanks to the volatility caused by the 14-month long war in the Middle East, data seen by Reuters show. Banks are expected to post $475 million in fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading (FICC) revenue linked to Israel in 2024, a more than 10% increase from 2023, amid increased volatility primarily in the shekel, the Israeli currency, data from Vali Analytics Ltd show. The revenue rise illustrates how global banks are making money on price gyrations in Israeli assets as the country's wars in Gaza and Lebanon grind on. The conflicts have boosted Israeli inflation, limited economic growth and increased borrowing costs. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, is expected to be the top gainer among 10 global lenders surveyed by the data firm, raking in about $70 million so far this year from such trades, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Though that is a tiny fraction of global trading income, the double-digit increase highlights how trading Israeli assets has been a bright spot in otherwise muted trading activity this year. Vali Analytics expects the 10 global banks to post no growth in FICC income overall this year. Goldman and Citigroup have the biggest share of the Israeli FICC market after JPMorgan, the person added, while European banks have a smaller portion. Goldman, Citi and JPMorgan declined to comment. Under pressure from activists and governments, some of Europe's biggest financial firms have cut back their links to Israeli companies or those with ties to the country, Reuters reported earlier this month. Reuters could not establish how European banks fared in the trading rankings. JPMorgan has been investing in Israel, where it opened its office in Tel Aviv in 2000. It currently has about 200 employees there. BIGGER SWINGS JPMorgan's global income from fixed-income markets trading declined by 2% to $14.7 billion in the nine months to September compared to the same period last year, according to a bank filing. Volatility favours traders who bet on the future direction of an asset. Early this month, the shekel's one-month implied volatility closed at its highest level since October 2023. It began to trade consistently above euro volatility in early 2023 - with the bigger peaks and troughs creating money-making opportunities for traders. \"Israeli currency volatility has increased as a result first of more divided politics and concerns over institutional stability with the controversial judicial reform and then, obviously, the war on multiple fronts,\" said Hasnain Malik, head of emerging and frontier markets equity strategy at Tellimer. The Israeli government passed a series of laws in 2023 aimed at neutering the powers of Israel's Supreme Court in favour of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's executive branch, alarming investors. The conflict in the region that followed further increased swings in markets. The shekel has strengthened by nearly 3% against the dollar this month due in part to hopes for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. \"That volatility suits banks whose spreads widen but hurts operating businesses exposed to imported inputs or exported finished products,\" Tellimer's Malik said.

                "title": "India’s PM Modi Says Guyana Crude Is Key For India’s Energy Security",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Two weeks ago, U.S. oil and gas giant, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced it had reached 500M barrels of oil produced from Guyana's offshore Stabroek block, just five years after it kicked off production at the location. According to Exxon, the first three projects--Liza Phase 1, Liza Phase 2 and Payara--are already pumping more than 650K bbl/day. The Exxon-led consortium which includes Hess Corp. (NYSE:HES) and China's Cnooc (OTCPK:CEOHF) have set a target to reach production of at least 1.3M bbl/day of oil by year-end 2027, a feat it hopes to achieve when six approved offshore projects come online. And now one of the world’s biggest oil consumers is eyeing the light and sweet crude produced by the tiny South American country. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday during a visit to Guyana that his government views Guyana as key to India’s energy security. Modi told a special sitting of Parliament that he views Guyana as an important energy source and that he will encourage large Indian businesses to invest in the country. Guyana did not immediately grant Modi’s wish, with India’s External Affairs Minister Jaideep Mazumdar saying talks will continue and that such a deal would ensure “greater predictability.” Guyanese Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat told reporters that Guyana is willing to supply India with a large amount of crude, if Exxon Mobil, the main operator in Guyana’s offshore oil production, agrees to such an arrangement. “We know Exxon has to do some amount of changes to their lifting schedule and logistics because their preference is for the very large vessels that can accommodate two million barrels mainly because of distance and cost,” Bharrat said. According to Bharrat, Guyana prefers that Indian companies bid for oil blocks and negotiations can proceed once a bid is submitted. Enhancing Energy Security With India recently becoming the biggest buyer of discounted Russian oil ahead of China, it appears counterintuitive that it would be so eager to buy crude from a country located nearly three times farther away than its much larger neighbor. Russian crude exports to India in July reached a record 2.07 million barrels per day (bpd) compared with 1.76 million bpd to China. However, energy security has become a critical issue for India due to its surging energy demand and limited domestic resources. Related: What Will Trump’s Approach Be To Saudi Arabia And OPEC+? Previously, we reported that India’s energy security has been severely compromised by the ongoing Middle East conflict. Whereas a lot of focus lately has been on India’s surging imports of Russian oil, the country actually buys the lion’s share of its oil from the Middle East. In August, the Middle East accounted for 44.6% of India’s crude imports, up from 40.3% in July. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait are the main Middle Eastern suppliers of oil to India. In contrast, the share of Russian crude fell to 36% after five straight months of increases. Meanwhile, India imports nearly half of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar. Back in February, India's Petronet LNG (PLL) and QatarEnergy inked a long-term LNG Sale & Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the supply of around 7.5 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) of LNG to India over the next 20 years. The deal involves LNG imports of $78 billion by the PLL during the contract period. India’s geostrategic positioning and access to two of the world’s most critical maritime chokepoints--the Malacca and Hormuz Straits--make it a critical player in the global oil trade. Hormuz is the world's most important oil transit choke point. Chokepoints are narrow channels along widely used global sea routes that are critical to global energy security. Even temporary disruptions that occur along these critical routes can lead to substantial increases in shipping costs, increasing world energy prices. Located between Oman and Iran, Hormuz connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The Strait of Hormuz is the only maritime link to the rest of the world for Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar, with their economies highly dependent on imports for basic necessities. Over 85% of India’s oil is imported via the Strait of Hormuz while key trade routes pass through the Malacca Strait. Together, these straits see over 60% of the world’s oil flow and a third of global trade, underscoring their strategic importance for not only India’s but the world’s energy security and economic continuity. Oil prices fell more $2 per barrel on Monday after reports emerged that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to the terms of a deal to end the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Reuters reported on Monday that a senior Israeli official said the country’s cabinet would meet on Tuesday to approve a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah, while a Lebanese official said Beirut had been told by Washington that an accord could be announced \"within hours\". \"It seems the news of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon is behind the price drop, though no supply has been disrupted due to the conflict between the two countries and the risk premium in oil has been low already before the latest price decline,\" said Giovanni Staunovo of UBS. It’s possible that these developments mark the beginning of de-escalation of tensions in the region. However, U.S. officials have warned that negotiations are not complete after previous hopes for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire were dashed. Further, the fact that Israel has dramatically ramped up its campaign of air strikes in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon just hours after news of a potential deal came out does not inspire a lot of confidence.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Tuesday, Citi upgraded Chevron Corp (CVX, Financial) to a \"buy\" rating. The investment bank noted that the company is trading at a 29% discount to the industry median on a price-to-book value basis and a 16% discount on a price-to-sales basis. The upgrade follows Chevron's underperformance compared to ExxonMobil (XOM, Financial), as stock prices in XOM and the broader market have remained relatively stagnant despite a slight improvement in the past two months. Citi analysts pointed out that Chevron is valued at 23% lower than Exxon, a record gap that could widen to 20% by 2026-2027. Optimism about Chevron's future is driven by its prospects in Namibia, where high-impact drilling opportunities are expected, along with the anticipated conclusion of the Hess arbitration by mid-2025. Based on these long-term growth prospects, Citi raised its price target for Chevron by $40 to $185. The brokerage also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corp (HES, Financial) presents a binary risk. However, Chevron's low forward P/E ratio means that downside risk is buffered, making this a solid entry point for potential upside if the arbitration favors Chevron. While the outcome of the Hess deal remains uncertain, Citi's upgrade signals confidence in Chevron's future growth prospects through strategic exploration and diversification.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Oil and gas producers in the US will not raise output significantly in the coming years despite calls from President-Elect Donald Trump to “drill, baby, drill,” said Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Upstream President Liam Mallon. “I think a radical change is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing,” Mallon said on Tuesday at a conference in London. Trump is expected to open up federal lands for more oil and gas drilling, but much of the land in the country’s largest oil and gas producing state, Texas, is private. Still, there’s plentiful federal land in neighboring New Mexico which includes the oil- and gas-rich Permian Basin. “If those rules were substantially changed, you would be able to drill more, assuming you have the quality and met your economic threshold,” Mallon said. “But I don’t think we’re going to see anybody in the drill, baby, drill mode. I really don’t.” Exxon’s European rival TotalEnergies SE is also skeptical of Trump’s vow to open US taps. “Maybe he has a magic recipe to push them to drill like mad,” TotalEnergies Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said at the conference. He cited US producers’ commitment to return cash to shareholders and said “it’s not only decisions by politicians” that drive American output. The US is pumping more than 13 million barrels of crude a day, exceeding every other nation and up almost 45% in the past decade. With a surplus looming next year, the global oil market is watching to see at what rate American explorers drill new wells. Many of the biggest US operators are taking a long-term approach to production, weighing when to bring certain wells online against their overall inventory. Mallon’s comments mark the second time since the election that the largest US oil company has diverged from Trump’s policies. CEO Darren Woods discouraged the president-elect from withdrawing the US from the Paris climate pact, arguing that it’s better to participate and push for “common sense” carbon-cutting policy. Mallon reinforced Woods’s recent remarks supporting the US Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has characterized as Washington’s “green new scam.” Some IRA incentives — including tax credits for capturing carbon, producing hydrogen and making sustainable aviation fuel — are particularly popular with oil companies. “Our position on the IRA is very good,” Mallon said. “We strongly believe in what it is, what it stands for and the incentives it’s providing.” (Updates with comments from TotalEnergies CEO.)

Investing.com -- Citi on Tuesday upgraded Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) to “buy” from “neutral” on valuation gap with peer, with upside from exploration in Namibia and the resolution of the Hess arbitration in 2025. Despite a modest recovery in Chevron's stock over the past two months, it has significantly underperformed both ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and the broader S&P 500 this year. Citi noted that Chevron's valuation trades at a historically wide discount to Exxon, which could reach 20% by 2026-2027 due to Chevron's “superior growth” prospects. Citi noted that investors had been reducing their overall exposure to energy stocks, with selloffs in Chevron amid uncertainty over the Guyana arbitration and timing of the Hess transaction. This has discounted its valuation, making an attractive investment opportunity. Brokerage bumps price target on stock by $40 to $185 citing longer-term growth potential and the exploration. Namibia drilling campaign could serve as a high-impact catalyst in the near term. Chevron's $53 billion deal for Hess Corp (NYSE:HES)., which the brokerage views as “value-neutral”, is critical for growth diversification but hinges on a mid-2025 arbitration ruling. While the outcome remains uncertain, Citi argued that Chevron’s lower valuation shields investors from substantial downside risk. “The ability to close the deal now depends on a mid-year ruling from an arbitration panel, creating a binary event around which confidentiality means it is impossible for investors to get any real certainty. But we argue that the value-discount now protects the downside, positioning investors for significant upside in a win scenario,” analysts at Citi said Related Articles Citi upgrades Chevron to ‘buy’ on valuation gap, 'superior growth' prospects Citigroup hires Kate Moore from BlackRock as wealth CIO S&P 500, Nasdaq open higher as investors assess Trump's tariff threats Sign in to access your portfolio",

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. DETROIT (AP) — Two towers at Detroit's iconic Renaissance Center would be razed and the complex converted to a mix of housing and offices under an ambitious $1.6 billion plan announced Monday. The complex, which next year will lose the headquarters of owner General Motors Co., is the symbol of Detroit, with aerial views often shown on television sports broadcasts. GM decided last spring to leave what's locally known as the “RenCen” for a more modern building being constructed downtown. GM said in April it would join forces with the Bedrock real estate development firm and Wayne County to turn the partially vacant property into a roughly 27-acre entertainment complex across the Detroit River from Windsor, Ontario. Under the plans, Bedrock would invest at least $1 billion in the property, with roughly $250 million more coming from GM and another $250 million in yet-to-be-allocated public money, possibly from the state of Michigan. The plan, called conceptual by Bedrock, would preserve most of the skyline and reduce the center's office footprint. Demolishing the two 39-story towers would free land for the waterfront project that would complement a walkway along the river, Bedrock said in a press release. A pedestrian promenade would link the heart of downtown to the riverfront, Bedrock said. The 73-story main tower would remain, with high-end housing on the upper floors, according to Crain's Detroit Business, which first reported the plans. GM CEO Mary Barra said last April that the move to a brand new state-of-the-art office building in the heart of the city will help GM recruit talent in the future. The new site, being built by Bedrock, is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) north of the Renaissance Center. The move also keeps GM’s headquarters in the city for the foreseeable future, she said.

                "title": "It's a small world: Why payment companies are targeting SMBs",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. UPDATE: This article includes comments from Hello Alice. Payment companies are carving out space in providing data analysis to small businesses, an area largely ignored by the big banks and where fintechs are making gains. Micro, small and medium businesses, because of their range of needs and more conservative budgets, pose challenges to data providers. To get payment analysis, these businesses have been turning to fintechs. In fact, while 67% of small businesses look to their retail bank as their primary service provider, more than half supplement their primary bank with one or more fintech offerings, according to research from Arizent, American Banker's publisher. In some cases, small and medium businesses are forced to find a secondary provider because their primary bank doesn't offer the service they require. In addition, about 75% of small businesses use digital tools daily, according to a May 2023 report from Mastercard. A quarter of those businesses say they use six or more digital tools daily. That landscape has paved the way for some of the largest payment companies in the U.S., such as JPMorgan Chase and Mastercard, to put an increased focus on SMBs with the launch of new tools that leverage their respective networks to provide insights to small-business owners. JPMorgan Chase earlier this month launched to its 5 million small-business banking customers a business intelligence tool called Customer Insights, which uses payment data to offer competitive analysis. Chase considers the product \"a game changer\" for its SMB clients, said John Frerichs, managing director and global head of small business payments at JPMorgan Chase. \"We are the largest payment processor by volume in the U.S., so we have a massive amount of data — literally millions of transactions — that we are able to view and then anonymize,\" Frerichs said. Small-business owners that process payments with JPMorgan can see reports from their own data on customer demographics, such as the age of the customer or the zip code they come from, or when to staff to meet high traffic, at no additional cost. For SMBs that don't process payments with the bank, JPMorgan offers a \"look-alike\" model that provides anonymized insights into similar businesses that also serves a key up-selling opportunity for payment processing services, Frerichs said. Cullen Fuller, co-owner of Meredith Jaye and M & Em's boutiques in Chicago, said on a Chase website that \"Customer Insights allows me to map the schedule back to our busy times and has allowed us to shave about 5% off of our labor numbers.\" Fuller said the tool helped save 20% on weekly payroll expenses. Mastercard this month also launched a new SMB insights tool that leans on its vast network to offer a white-label, software-as-a-service business intelligence solution called Biz360 to its platform partners. \"SMBs have been traditionally underserved, in part because they sort of fall between consumers who are the focus of a lot of attention of financial services players and others, and large corporates who kind of qualify for white-glove one-on-one treatment,\" said Jane Prokop, executive vice president of small and medium enterprises at Mastercard. \"Small businesses are sort of in the middle.\" Mastercard is targeting its platform partners that serve small businesses rather than the small businesses themselves, Prokop said. \"There's a wide range of players with whom we have worked in the past and where we're doubling down now in our partnerships with them, because our goal is to provide products to our partners that they can turn around and use to better serve their SMB customers.\" Hello Alice, an educational platform that connects SMBs with grant and lending opportunities and has 1.5 million SMBs registered on its platform, is Mastercard's first customer in North America. Prokop said there are also a wide range of use cases for fintechs, neo-banks, digital wallet providers, payment processors and gateways, credit card issuers and acquirers, and other financial institutions as well as nonbank platform providers to offer the service to their clients. Small businesses on Hello Alice's platform are \"constantly vetting new tools, trying to ensure that one syncs with the other, and juggling the management of multiple interfaces,\" said Carolyn Rodz, CEO and co-founder of Hello Alice. \"Ultimately, SMB's are looking to manage time and discover insights that help them grow. Entrepreneurs have to jump between the various aspects of their businesses to build healthy, solid foundations – and that includes sales, marketing, finance, fundraising, cybersecurity and so much more,\" Rodz said. \"These are the fundamentals of how we assess how healthy their businesses are, and to ensure they're looking broadly at the fundamentals of their businesses because our research shows that when businesses have a strong baseline for growth, they're significantly more likely to sustain operations.\" Biz360 integrates tools that SMBs are already using — such as Quickbooks for bookkeeping — into a single place. It also provides additional insights about their business that SMBs wouldn't be able to see otherwise, Prokop said. There are billing, payment and invoice tools as well as marketing and customer acquisition functionality. \"Everything [SMBs] do is generating data,\" Prokop said. \"Most of the time, though, they can't see it, so [Biz360] is giving them visibility into their own data, which they, by and large, don't have. That helps them understand where they have weak spots, where they're doing well and course correct on how they operate the business.\" Both JPMorgan and Mastercard are responding to an influx of SMB-focused fintech offerings that threaten to continue moving up-market if left unchecked, said Tony DeSanctis, senior director at Cornerstone Advisors. \"I can remember 10 years ago when I was at the last bank I worked at. We never really cracked the nut on how to be successful in what I would call small and micro businesses,\" DeSanctis said. \"The fintechs have done a great job of adding ancillary services and capabilities that make it so that the primary reason you do business with them is not price, not interest rate, it's not fees. \"Unlike consumers, who basically want everything for free, small businesses are willing to pay a premium if it means that you can free them up to do whatever for their businesses instead of the back office.\" Block, Divvy, Ramp and Brex are all examples of fintechs that have been focusing on small and startup-sized businesses, he said. Customer expectations have also changed, DeSanctis said. \"You can go to any bank and get a business checking account. But you can't go to any bank and get the kind of service that a Square is providing, or even some of the tools that the Brexs and the Ramps and some of those other folks are providing, which is why I think you're starting to see recognition by [larger] financial institutions.\" The shift in strategy also makes good on a promise to leverage data that payments companies have been making for years but \"haven't really done a great job fulfilling,\" said Aaron Press, a research director for IDC Insights. Payment companies are \"starting to recognize how this payment data is valuable beyond just the payment use case,\" Press said. \"It really provides a lot of great consumer insights, and bringing it down to the SMB level as a service… is a great way for organizations to differentiate [themselves].\" SMBs also represent higher margin businesses, because they don't get the same volume discounts as larger enterprises, but are harder to serve because of \"sheer numbers\" and varying budgets and business needs, Press said. There were 34.8 million small businesses in the U.S. as of March 2023, according to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy. \"If you get these companies in the fold, you can create and you give them something really valuable, you create sticky, high-margin relationships,\" Press said. JPMorgan and Mastercard are betting that their new solutions will help them stand out from rising fintech competition and be a one-stop shop for business intelligence needs. \"The two things that SMBs don't have in abundance is time and expertise,\" Mastercard's Prokop said. \"They can't be experts in every area or function of the business… there are all these areas in which corporations have very large and dedicated staffs who are quite specialized. \"Small businesses don't have that luxury,\" she said. \"Time is of the essence for them.\" Sign in to access your portfolio",

(Bloomberg) -- One of the biggest purchases this year in the private equity secondaries market marks the arrival of a major new institutional investor.

Now it has a new mandate to pare that stake, valued at roughly $50 billion, and diversify into a range of assets. So far this year, that has meant starting a money-management arm and attracting talent from some of Canada’s biggest pension plans. Now, Mastercard Foundation Asset Management Corp., which debuted this year, is buying private equity stakes for a discount. The board of Eastman Kodak Co.’s pension plan agreed to sell private equity ownership interests and other illiquid assets valued at $764.4 million to the Mastercard Foundation for $550.6 million, according to a regulatory filing. The sale is expected to be completed at year-end. MFAM’s board features a roster of big names in Canadian finance, including Lynn Patterson, a former Bank of Canada deputy governor, and Jim Leech, who was chief executive officer of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan for more than six years until retiring about a decade ago. The asset manager’s chief investment officer is John Barker, who previously held that role for more than a decade at health-care system Mass General Brigham. Before that, he was a managing director at Harvard Management Co. Toronto-based MFAM has been on an expansion drive and building out its team, attracting employees from OTPP and other Canadian pension plans. Its leaders include Chief Technology Officer Dan Houle and Danilo Simonelli, who joined as managing director after almost 20 years at Ontario Teachers’. MFAM is currently Mastercard’s biggest shareholder, with a stake of about 10%. Barker plans to diversify the portfolio over the next seven years, unloading 13% to 15% of Mastercard stock each year. MFAM will initially partner with third-party managers before considering direct investment, Barker said in a May interview. The shares, donated to the foundation around the time of Mastercard’s 2006 initial public offering, have climbed more than 13,000% since then, making it one of the S&P 500’s best performers in that span. The foundation’s charitable efforts include working to help young people in Africa and indigenous children in Canada.

There aren't as many famous brands in the financial sector as in, say, consumer electronics. Finance tends to be a fairly straightforward without cool new products. There are exceptions, though, and payment card giant Mastercard (NYSE: MA) is one of the very few. Mastercard's fame comes from its ubiquity as the No. 2 payment card brand (behind leader Visa) on the planet. Millions of Americans have at least one Mastercard credit or debit card in their possession, and this monster presence makes the company powerful and important. Yet its popularity has slipped a bit recently after its share price peaked just north of $530. Let's explore whether this relative weakness makes its stock a buy now. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Although Mastercard (like Visa) is often referred to as a credit card company, that isn't entirely appropriate. Yes, its branding adorns many such instruments, so many people assume it is the entity also issuing the credit packed into them. Mastercard is not, in fact, the issuer -- outside entities, typically banks, are the ones providing the credit. Mastercard is responsible for processing the transactions, and shifting the funds where they need to go. Since it doesn't have to trouble itself with evaluating and monitoring creditworthiness, Mastercard (and Visa too, while we're at it) can be a relatively lean operation managing those particulars. It takes a small slice of every purchase for this work. That makes for a powerful and high-margin business, since there are a vast number of Mastercard transactions being made globally 24/7. Last year the company reaped more than $25 billion in revenue on these tiny slices; this gives you an idea of just how huge its business is these days. That number is only set to grow, in both the immediate and long-range future. We're in the midst of a long-term consumer transition from cash purchases to those made by other means, most notably payment cards. The U.S. is far along with this transition, but in more traditional parts of the world it's taking more time. Regardless, when folks change their habits from physical currency to plastic, Mastercard is often the beneficiary. This makes Mastercard -- and, again, Visa -- a mighty company in an enviable position, as an already high-margin business facing years of bottom-up growth from a social trend. The company's performance bears this out. In the third quarter it collected $7.4 billion in net revenue, which was 13% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP (adjusted and not compliant with generally accepted accounting principles) net profit increased even more, notching a 15% gain to $3.6 billion. It's worth noting that the resulting net margin was a very substantial 49%. Mastercard's trajectory is more impressive if you zoom out a bit. On an annual basis, that top line has improved markedly and consistently since the start of this decade, rising from just over $15 billion in 2020 to more than $25 billion in 2023. Along the way net income almost doubled, rising to $11 billion-plus from $6.4 billion in 2020. There's a catch here. No company as prominent in its industry and posting such results will escape the market's notice, and even after the stock price sag Mastercard isn't a bargain on valuations. The company's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is nearly 40 and its forward P/E based on analyst profit estimates isn't much lower, at a shade under 32. Famous peers in the finance industry are cheaper; JPMorgan Chase's numbers are a respective 14 and 15, while the scores for ever-influential investment bank Goldman Sachs are similar, at 18 and 15. Mastercard isn't impressive as a dividend stock either, with a comparatively measly yield of 0.5% on its current payout. It's almost guaranteed that if an investor closed his or her eyes and picked a dividend-paying stock at random, its yield would be substantially higher. So Mastercard isn't a perfect stock and I can't say it's a howling bargain despite the sell-off. The company is, however, a major part of the global financial ecosystem and an essential part of its future. The world will continue to increasingly swipe and tap to buy things, and the card giant will be right there to reap substantial rewards. That's the kind of powerful business that's worth paying a premium for, and forgoing a juicy dividend yield. Mastercard is absolutely a buy, in my mind, especially at this price.

(Bloomberg) -- The board of Eastman Kodak’s pension plan sold a portfolio of illiquid assets to the Mastercard Foundation and is considering winding down the rest of the fund, as the company looks to tap the roughly $1 billion surplus it built up over the years.

The plan has also agreed to sell private equity ownership interests and other illiquid assets valued at $764.4 million to the Mastercard Foundation for $550.6 million, the filing said. This sale is expected to close at year end. Kodak shares surged as much as 25% as of 10:30 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday move since February, when Bloomberg reported that the company was mulling tapping the pension surplus. Kodak said that even after capitalizing a replacement pension and paying an excise tax, it expected to get $530 million to $585 million of proceeds from the moves. That was more than than the company’s market capitalization on Friday. In recent years the plan, which manages a pool of retirement assets for more than 37,000 people, poured money into hedge funds and private equity and turned a $255 million deficit into a significant surplus. Kodak estimates the pension will have surplus assets of between $885 million and $975 million after its liabilities have been paid, according to the statement, which also said that this would not affect the plan’s members. Liabilities to current and future retirees will be covered through a combination of lump-sum distributions and the purchase of an annuity from an insurance company, for those that prefer that option. In March Kodak said it was moving management of the pension to an outside firm while it weighed how best to utilize the extra assets.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the world's largest social media company, has seen its shares soar nearly 660% over the past decade. That rally was driven by the rapid growth of its core apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp) and its surging ad revenues. It now shares a near-duopoly in the digital advertising market with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google in many countries. During the same decade, Alphabet's shares advanced just over 500%. Most of that growth was fueled by Google's search engine, YouTube, and its cloud platform. Those services -- along with its market-leading Chrome browser, Android mobile OS, Gmail, and other products -- fed plenty of data to its core advertising business. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Yet Google remains an underdog in the cloud infrastructure race, and it failed to leverage its dominance of the search market to launch a lasting social media platform. It also faces some existential challenges: The rise of generative AI search engines like OpenAI's SearchGPT could disrupt its core search business, it faces antitrust probes in multiple markets, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) wants it to sell Chrome. As of this writing, Meta has a market cap of $1.4 trillion while Alphabet is worth $2 trillion. So could the social media king eclipse the struggling search leader's valuation by the end of 2025? Let's dive deeper into these two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to decide. Meta and Alphabet focus on different markets, but they both still generate most of their revenue from digital ads. From 2018 to 2023, Meta's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%, while Alphabet's revenue rose at a CAGR of 18%. Metric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Meta Platforms revenue growth 27% 22% 37% (1%) 16% Alphabet revenue growth 18% 13% 41% 10% 9% Data source: Company earnings reports. In 2020, Meta and Alphabet both struggled with slower ad sales as the pandemic forced many businesses to reduce their marketing expenses. Alphabet partly offset that pressure with Google Cloud's growth. Both companies' ad businesses bounced back in 2021 as the pandemic headwinds waned and the macro environment stabilized. In 2022, both companies generated slower sales growth upon lapping that recovery. However, Meta faced a tougher slowdown after Apple's iOS update allowed its users to opt-out of targeted ads from third-party apps. Stiff competition from ByteDance's TikTok in the short video market exacerbated that pressure. In 2023, Meta's growth accelerated again as it countered Apple's changes with more AI-powered tools for harvesting first-party data, expanded Reels to keep up with TikTok, and attracted big ad purchases from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies. Alphabet's growth cooled off again as Google's advertising business faced tougher macro and competitive challenges. YouTube's growth also slowed down. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16%, and Meta's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 25%. That growth should be driven by the ongoing expansion of Meta's family of apps, which served 3.29 billion daily active people in its latest quarter, and the rollout of new augmented and virtual reality products through its Reality Labs unit. Meta's Reality Labs business is still unprofitable, but it's consistently offsetting those losses with the growth of its higher-margin advertising business. A potential ban or tighter restrictions for TikTok in the U.S. could potentially drive more users toward Reels. Meta also faces some antitrust pressure -- including a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that targets its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp -- but that trial is still in the early stages and not an immediate threat like the DOJ's call for Google to sell Chrome. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 12%, and its EPS to rise at a CAGR of 21%. That outlook assumes the macro environment will warm up, its ad and cloud sales will remain stable, and it won't be significantly disrupted by the generative AI and antitrust challenges. However, those estimates will likely be reduced if the DOJ successfully forces Google to divest Chrome's data-rich business. Alphabet trades at 19 times forward earnings, which makes it the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Meta is still the second cheapest with a forward multiple of 22. Assuming both companies match Wall Street's expectations and still trade at the same forward multiples by the end of 2025, Alphabet's market cap could rise 16% to $191 as Meta's stock climbs 15% to $642. That would boost Alphabet's market cap to $2.4 billion and Meta's market cap to $1.6 trillion. If both stocks trade at 20 times forward earnings by the end of 2025, Alphabet would be worth $2.6 trillion while Meta would still have a market cap of about $1.4 trillion. So unless Alphabet's growth abruptly stalls out over the next few quarters, it seems unlikely that it will be less valuable than Meta by the end of 2025. That said, Meta's stronger growth and milder regulatory headwinds might still make it a better long-term buy than Alphabet. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

We recently published a list of 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years. “Just to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we’ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get—very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they’ve trained haven’t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, “There is no wall,” so maybe it’s not an issue—we’ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.” However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market. “I think if you take a longer-term view—2 to 4 years—we’re still very confident we’ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn’t mean there won’t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we’ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Twin Design / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, discussed Meta earnings in a program on CNBC and said the stock remains among his favorites for the rest of this year. “Meta came out, had solid results, but they always guide conservatively in the September quarter for the outlook, and the stock sold off, which is what we expected it to do.” Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets.

Consider, for example, that a study by Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research found that between 1973 and 2023, companies that grew or initiated dividend payments delivered annualized returns of 10.2%, while dividend non-payers delivered only 4.3% (and an equal-weight S&P 500 fund averaged 7.7%).  Healthy and growing dividend payers will tend to have stock prices that rise over time, while paying dividends that are also increased over time.  Given that stock profile, you might think it's smart to snap up the fattest dividend yields you can find -- perhaps focusing on the biggest dividend yields in the S&P 500.

                "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If you're looking for the best stocks to buy and hold forever, borrowing a pick or two from Warren Buffett is never a bad idea. He's not called the Oracle of Omaha for nothing, after all. There's a reason his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has been able to outperform the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the years. Here's a rundown of three of your best Warren Buffett bets right now, while they're arguably undervalued. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?  Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free » The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is the world's biggest beverage name, including brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and a slew of others in addition to its namesake cola. It does about $46 billion worth of business every year right now, but regularly raises its top and bottom lines. Ditto for its dividend, which has been upped every year for the past 62 years. This reliable income is a key reason Buffett has stuck with this cash cow since first stepping into it in 1988. And don't look for this streak to end anytime soon, if ever. Unlike rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola doesn't bottle the bulk of its products. Most of its revenue comes from the sale of branded concentrate to franchised bottlers, which in turn handle the production and distribution that get its products on store shelves. Although this arrangement means less revenue relative to the amount of its beverages consumers are drinking, it's a higher-margin model since the bottlers shoulder most of the cost-based risk. Higher profit margins, in turn, mean more per-share earnings that support continued dividend payments. Berkshire Hathaway's 400 million shares of Coca-Cola are worth nearly $26 billion, by the way -- the conglomerate's fourth-biggest holding. That in and of itself is a hint worth taking. So, what's Berkshire Hathaway's single-biggest holding? Buffett -- or at least one of his lieutenants -- has been shedding its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time now. However, its remaining 300 million shares (worth $69 billion) leave Apple as Bearkshire's top investment. Again, take the hint. When Berkshire began buying Apple in 2016, it caught people a little off-guard. Buffett has generally not been a fan of technology stocks, explaining that it's difficult to figure out what they're worth simply because their technologies can be difficult to understand; they may or may not keep competitors at bay. As time has marched on, though, the Apple purchase has made more and more sense. Its customers are fiercely loyal, and the company makes perpetually competitive products. The launch of its services (apps, digital content, and the like) also now drives the kind of recurring revenue that Buffett has often sought, accounting for about one-fourth of Apple's current top line. Berkshire has shed half of its stake in the consumer technology giant this year alone, but don't read too much into that. Buffett is not afraid to load up on a company he believes in, but even by his standards, Apple was becoming a dangerously big position at roughly half the value of all his investments in publicly traded investments. He may also be wary of sitting on such a profitable pick when tax rates on capital gains may be about to rise. The average newcomer like yourself, though, wouldn't face these concerns. The same reasons he liked it then still apply for newcomers now: its leadership in the smartphone market and the growth in services revenue that the iPhone is increasingly driving. Last year's services business improved another 12%, extending a well-established growth trend. Lastly, although it's rarely pointed out when talking about Warren Buffett's stock picks, you should know that Buffett himself doesn't necessarily personally own Apple, Coca-Cola, or any of the other tickers found within the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. He does, however, own a massive amount of Berkshire Hathaway shares -- on the order of 15% of Berkshire (which now has a market cap right around $1 trillion), and roughly one-third of the conglomerate's voting shares. As the cliché inelegantly but accurately explains, he eats his own cooking. In other words, Buffett is on the same side of the table as Berkshire's shareholders. It takes some of the excitement out of poaching a few of the Oracle of Omaha's picks for yourself. But investing should first and foremost be about results, and Berkshire Hathaway certainly delivers them. While it doesn't happen every single year, given enough time, Berkshire itself readily outperforms the broad market. This is at least partly the result of Buffett's (and his management team's) patience with Berkshire's holdings, something many investors struggle with. But it's also because the bulk of its value isn't in the publicly traded stocks it holds, but rather in the privately held entities it owns. These include cash drivers like flooring company Shaw, Duracell batteries, Pilot travel centers, Clayton Homes, and Geico auto insurance, to name a few. These are great companies you simply can't hold any other way. Just bear in mind that while Berkshire is collecting lots of recurring cash from its holdings, it's not dishing this money out in the form of dividends, which it doesn't pay. Rather, it's amassing this money, waiting for the next big buying opportunity -- something else Warren Buffett has demonstrated incredible patience for. So don't let Berkshire's current record-breaking cash hoard of $325 billion deter you from buying in. When the right opportunity comes along, Buffett will begin buying it before announcing it.

When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Coca-Cola (KO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Coca-Cola currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.7% and 4.6% of all recommendations. Check price target & stock forecast for Coca-Cola here>>>The ABR suggests buying Coca-Cola, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coca-Cola, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.85. Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coca-Cola. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coca-Cola.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other dividend aristocrat stocks. Investors usually buy stocks with the expectation that their value will increase as the company grows more profitable. However, stocks can offer additional advantages. As businesses succeed and mature, they often choose to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as cash dividends. Even more appealing are companies that not only pay dividends but consistently increase them year after year. These stocks have delivered impressive performance over time compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Thornburg Investment Management, from 1990 to 2023, bond yields, represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, fell significantly from nearly 9% to 3.41%. Similarly, equity yields, reflected by the dividend payouts on the Dividend Aristocrats Index, declined from just over 3% to 2.42% during the same period. The Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks large-cap, blue-chip US companies within the broader market that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. The report further mentioned that dividend-paying stocks can not only offer a source of current income with the potential for growth over time but also help investors bring greater stability to their portfolios in the long run. The report cited Bloomberg’s data and highlighted that dividend aristocrats delivered an 11.63% return to shareholders between 1990 to 2023, compared with a 10.2% return for the broader market. Excluding the aristocrat factor from dividend stocks highlights their significance in overall market returns. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the broader market’s total returns, with the remaining 68% coming from capital appreciation. This demonstrates that both steady dividend income and the potential for capital growth play crucial roles in shaping total return expectations. The report also highlighted the significant impact of compounding when it comes to dividends. Without dividends, the market’s return from January 1, 1930, to the end of July 2023 would have grown to 214%. However, if dividends had been reinvested during the same period, the return would have reached an impressive 7,219%. Also read: 8 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now The dividend aristocrat index has delivered a 12.5% return since the start of 2024, underperforming the broader market that has returned nearly 27%. Although dividend stocks have lagged in performance this year, companies continue to increase their payouts, reflecting investor preferences steadily. According to a recent report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, 480 dividend increases were recorded in Q3 2024, compared to 448 in Q3 2023, representing a 7.1% year-over-year growth. The total value of these increases for the quarter reached $14.1 billion. Over the past 12 months, dividend increases amounted to $74.7 billion, up from $63.9 billion in the previous year. Our Methodology: For this article, we first listed down all dividend aristocrat stocks — the companies with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them, as per Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database.

We recently published a list of 8 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against best beverage stocks that pay dividends. Retail sales rebounded significantly in October as the economy remained stable and consumers overcame worries about a port strike and other challenges that had dampened sales in September, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumer spending picked up again in October, supported by job growth and increased wages throughout the year. He observed that inflation remained largely confined to services, with prices for some retail goods even declining. Shay indicated that October’s sales performance had laid a solid foundation for the holiday shopping season to begin on a positive note. When we examine specific sectors, we see that grocery and beverage stores experienced a 0.87% increase on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis and a 3.76% rise year-over-year without seasonal adjustments. The food and beverage industry faced significant challenges during the pandemic. While in-home consumption surged, out-of-home dining virtually ceased, leading to a substantial decline in business and severely impacting the sector. Since then, the industry has undergone numerous transformations and is now in a recovery phase. According to a Market Research report, the global food and beverages market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. The market's growth is being driven by shifting consumer habits, out-of-town retail parks, and retail stores.

In 2023, spending on out-of-home cold coffee, such as iced coffee, cold brew, and frozen coffee drinks, reached $17.7 billion—more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2016, according to the food service research firm Technomic. Additionally, the National Coffee Association (NCA) reported that coffee consumption outside the home has returned to pre-pandemic levels as people resume visiting coffee shops and workplaces. Over a third of consumers who drank coffee on a given day did so away from home, marking the highest rate since January 2020, as highlighted in the NCA's National Coffee Data Trends report. Consumer behavior plays a critical role in shaping any industry, and the beverage sector is no exception. This industry is adapting to evolving preferences, with more Americans seeking alternatives to alcohol. Beverage companies emphasizing the health benefits of their products are striving to tap into this trend. According to data insights firm NCSolutions, over 40% of Americans aim to reduce their alcohol consumption in 2024, an increase from 34% the previous year. Among Generation Z, this figure rises to 61%, compared to 40% in 2023 who expressed similar intentions. Technology stocks have been the standout performers this year, with gains of nearly 29%. While food and beverage stocks haven't seen exceptional growth, the Food & Beverage index, which represents companies across various sub-industries in the sector, has still delivered a modest year-to-date return of 7.5%. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen by approximately 14%.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against the other oversold healthcare stocks. Investing in healthcare stocks during lean economic times is generally regarded as defensive. This is because people typically do not cut back on their use of prescription medications or other essential healthcare services, even during difficult financial times. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), national healthcare spending is projected to reach an estimated $4.8 trillion in 2023 and grow at an annual rate of 5.6% between 2027 and 2032. In the US, the healthcare sector is flourishing. According to a recent estimate, the country's healthcare spending increased by 7.5% in 2023, above the nominal GDP growth rate for the same year. A record 93.1% of Americans now have health insurance, which helped fuel last year's sharp increase in healthcare spending. The United States' national healthcare spending is expected to increase at an average rate of 5.6% between 2023 and 2032, above the 4.3% growth predicted for GDP. Additionally, the industry is growing quickly on a global scale. According to recent McKinsey projections, healthcare profits would increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% from $583 billion in 2022 to over $800 billion by 2027. Although labor shortages and rising inflation rates continued to put pressure on the business in 2023, a good risk-reward climate in the sector is expected to make 2024 a year of recovery. According to the American investment firm, the events of 2023 have produced an alluring opportunity for investors to engage in the healthcare industry. Investments in AI within the healthcare sector have grown rapidly, outpacing the tech industry, with $2.8 billion invested in AI healthcare corporations in 2024, and over $11 billion expected by the end of the year. According to a Silicon Valley Bank report, one-quarter of healthcare spending now goes to AI-driven companies. Deloitte's 2024 Global Health Care Sector Outlook highlights high investor confidence, with $31.5 billion in private equity funding between 2019 and 2022. AI is expected to save $360 billion in U.S. healthcare over the next five years by improving patient care, diagnosis, treatment, and medical administration. Optimism in the healthcare industry is growing as 2024 goes on. Financial experts anticipate better earnings this year despite 2023's poor performance. The healthcare industry has a \"favorable risk-reward environment,\" according to BlackRock's 2024 prediction, which also notes that investors now have an appealing starting point because of last year's poor performance. In view of this, we will take a look at oversold stocks from the healthcare sector. For our methodology, we used a stock screener and selected healthcare stocks that had an RSI below 30, mid-market cap, and high institutional ownership. Then we ranked the stocks based on their total number of hedge fund holders as of Insider Monkey’s database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A scientist surrounded by vials and beakers in a modern laboratory, proudly displaying a vaccine. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a biotechnology company specializing in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines. It creates synthetic mRNA to instruct cells to produce proteins for preventing or treating various diseases, focusing on mRNA-based solutions for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) plans to file for approval of three new products this year: a new COVID/flu vaccine, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, and an RSV vaccine for adults aged 18-59. While the RSV vaccine rollout and positive EMA opinion boost investor confidence, the company also reports positive Phase III results for the flu/COVID-19 combo vaccine and partnerships with BARDA and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. To save $1.1 billion annually by 2027, Moderna will discontinue five R&D programs and aims for operational breakeven by 2028, while continuing to advance clinical trials for mRNA-1647 and mRNA-3705. In Q3 2024, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported an EPS of $0.03, and achieved a net income of $13 million, reversing a $3.6 billion loss in Q3 2023. The company's revenue reached $1.9 billion, driven by strong COVID-19 vaccine sales following U.S. regulatory approval of its updated vaccine. The company reduced operating expenses by $500 million year-over-year through improved productivity and cost efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D, and SG&A. Additionally, the cost of sales dropped 77% to $514 million, reflecting strategic restructuring and lower inventory write-downs, enhancing profitability. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter: “Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID-19 vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government-funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.” Overall MRNA ranks 6th on our list of the oversold healthcare stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On Tuesday, Citi upgraded Chevron Corp (CVX, Financial) to a \"buy\" rating. The investment bank noted that the company is trading at a 29% discount to the industry median on a price-to-book value basis and a 16% discount on a price-to-sales basis. The upgrade follows Chevron's underperformance compared to ExxonMobil (XOM, Financial), as stock prices in XOM and the broader market have remained relatively stagnant despite a slight improvement in the past two months. Citi analysts pointed out that Chevron is valued at 23% lower than Exxon, a record gap that could widen to 20% by 2026-2027. Optimism about Chevron's future is driven by its prospects in Namibia, where high-impact drilling opportunities are expected, along with the anticipated conclusion of the Hess arbitration by mid-2025. Based on these long-term growth prospects, Citi raised its price target for Chevron by $40 to $185. The brokerage also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corp (HES, Financial) presents a binary risk. However, Chevron's low forward P/E ratio means that downside risk is buffered, making this a solid entry point for potential upside if the arbitration favors Chevron. While the outcome of the Hess deal remains uncertain, Citi's upgrade signals confidence in Chevron's future growth prospects through strategic exploration and diversification.

Investing.com -- Citi on Tuesday upgraded Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) to “buy” from “neutral” on valuation gap with peer, with upside from exploration in Namibia and the resolution of the Hess arbitration in 2025. Despite a modest recovery in Chevron's stock over the past two months, it has significantly underperformed both ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and the broader S&P 500 this year. Citi noted that Chevron's valuation trades at a historically wide discount to Exxon, which could reach 20% by 2026-2027 due to Chevron's “superior growth” prospects. Citi noted that investors had been reducing their overall exposure to energy stocks, with selloffs in Chevron amid uncertainty over the Guyana arbitration and timing of the Hess transaction. This has discounted its valuation, making an attractive investment opportunity. Brokerage bumps price target on stock by $40 to $185 citing longer-term growth potential and the exploration. Namibia drilling campaign could serve as a high-impact catalyst in the near term. Chevron's $53 billion deal for Hess Corp (NYSE:HES)., which the brokerage views as “value-neutral”, is critical for growth diversification but hinges on a mid-2025 arbitration ruling. While the outcome remains uncertain, Citi argued that Chevron’s lower valuation shields investors from substantial downside risk. “The ability to close the deal now depends on a mid-year ruling from an arbitration panel, creating a binary event around which confidentiality means it is impossible for investors to get any real certainty. But we argue that the value-discount now protects the downside, positioning investors for significant upside in a win scenario,” analysts at Citi said Related Articles Citi upgrades Chevron to ‘buy’ on valuation gap, 'superior growth' prospects Citigroup hires Kate Moore from BlackRock as wealth CIO S&P 500, Nasdaq open higher as investors assess Trump's tariff threats Sign in to access your portfolio",

Social Security's future looks increasingly uncertain. According to the latest trustee report, the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2037, a timeline that could significantly affect anyone still decades away from retirement. At that point, payable benefits would drop to just 76% of scheduled amounts. This means workers in their 50s and younger need to approach retirement planning with the assumption that Social Security may play a smaller role in their financial future. Taking concrete steps today to build additional retirement income streams isn't just prudent; it's becoming essential for securing true financial independence. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Fortunately, a carefully constructed income portfolio can help bridge this potential gap. Let's examine three investments that could provide reliable passive income to supplement reduced Social Security benefits. Rithm Capital (NYSE: RITM), a real estate investment trust (REIT), stands out for both its high yield and financial strength. The company has delivered 87% price appreciation since May 2020, with total returns reaching 187% when including reinvested dividends in a tax-advantaged account. At current prices, investors can lock in a 9.38% yield that's well-supported by the company's operations. That attractive yield rests on solid financial footing. In the third quarter of 2024, Rithm Capital generated $270.3 million in earnings available for distribution, or $0.54 per share, more than double its $0.25 quarterly dividend payment. The REIT's financial stability stems from its diversified business model across mortgage servicing, asset management, and real estate lending. This broad platform has proven capable of generating steady income through different market cycles, making Rithm Capital particularly attractive for retirement portfolios seeking reliable quarterly income. Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) brings both growth and income stability to retirement portfolios through its integrated energy operations. Over the past 10 years, the oil giant has rewarded shareholders with a 36.9% share price increase, while delivering a 109% total return when including reinvested dividends. Today's investors can secure a 4.02% yield backed by decades of operational excellence. The company maintains a sustainable 70.3% payout ratio, meaning it pays out about $0.70 in dividends for every dollar of earnings. At 13.4 times forward earnings, Chevron trades at a significant discount to the S&P 500's 23 multiple, offering both dividend reliability and compelling value. Chevron's integrated business model, spanning oil production to retail gas stations, provides natural hedges against energy price swings. This operational diversity helps maintain dividend stability even when oil prices fluctuate. The Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF (NASDAQ: VYMI) rounds out a retirement income strategy by tapping into global dividend streams. Since its 2016 launch, this fund has provided access to established dividend payers across developed and emerging markets at a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds. With an expense ratio of just 0.22% compared to the category average of 0.96%, more dividend income flows through to investors. The Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF broad reach spans nearly 1,500 stocks across multiple regions and sectors. European dividend payers make up 44.3% of assets, while Pacific region stocks contribute 25.7% and emerging markets add 21.5%. This geographic diversity helps insulate retirement income from any single country's economic challenges. These three investments create multiple streams of retirement income through complementary approaches. Rithm Capital delivers high current yield through real estate finance, Chevron provides growing energy dividends backed by hard assets, and the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF adds global diversification at low cost. While Social Security's future may be uncertain, this balanced portfolio approach can help protect retirement lifestyles. By combining Rithm's high yield, Chevron's steady growth, and the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF's international exposure, retirees can build a resilient income stream for the decades ahead.

For decades, investors have turned to Warren-Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway for ideas, his sentiment on the market, and top stocks to buy. Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks in 2024 -- amassing a record-high $325 billion cash position. But Berkshire's fifth- and sixth-largest holdings remain the same. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Berkshire owns $19.07 billion of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stock, giving it 6.6% ownership. It also owns $13 billion in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) stock, representing a 27.2% stake. Here's Berkshire's background in each company and which dividend stock is the better buy now. Chevron is an integrated oil and gas major and one of the world's most valuable non-nationalized energy companies. Berkshire began building a stake in early 2021, but the real jump came in the first quarter of 2022. Except for a noteworthy sale in the first quarter of 2023, Chevron has remained a key holding for Berkshire and a notable exception to the selling spree in Apple, Bank of America, and other top holdings in 2024. Chevron remains one of the best oil and gas dividend stocks to buy now, even with West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices below $70 a barrel. Chevron has invested in quality over quantity, giving it a diversified asset portfolio that can break even at lower oil prices. For example, around 75% of Chevron's locations can break even below $50 per barrel -- giving Chevron a sizable margin of error even compared to current oil prices. Chevron has paid and raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Its most recent raise was 8%, which it announced in February. In addition to paying a boatload of dividends, Chevron generates plenty of capital to reinvest in the business and repurchase stock. To top it all off, Chevron has an elite balance sheet with very low leverage. Chevron further strengthened its balance sheet earlier this fall by selling its Canadian assets to Canadian Natural Resources for $6.5 billion. Berkshire's history in Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, dates back to 2019 when Berkshire helped Oxy fund the purchase of fellow exploration and production (E&P) company Anadarko Petroleum. The deal gave Berkshire 100,000 shares of preferred stock valued at $100,000 per share with an 8% annual dividend and a warrant to purchase up to 80 million more shares at $62.50 per share. Since then, Berkshire has bought more Oxy stock, bringing its position to a 27.5% stake in the company. But Berkshire could own much more if it exercised its warrants. Oxy paid top dollar for Anadarko in 2019, coincidentally outbidding Chevron. Because of the deal, Oxy entered the oil and gas downturn of 2020 overleveraged and saw its stock price fall to single digits. But the subsequent boom in 2021 and 2022 was a huge win for Oxy, which was able to pay down debt thanks to higher oil prices. Then, in late 2023, Oxy announced that it would acquire CrownRock L.P. to boost its Permian Basin exposure further. It closed the deal on Aug. 1, 2024. Although the deal made Oxy, once again, more leveraged, it could pay off as long as oil prices remain around current levels. Oxy's latest quarter showed strong results, plenty of free cash flow, and a path toward paying down debt. Despite the good quarter, Oxy's stock price remains just a few percentage points off its 52-week low, which makes sense given oil prices are also around a 52-week low. Oxy is a much higher risk, higher potential reward play than Chevron because it is an E&P rather than an integrated major. The vast majority of its portfolio is in one region -- the Permian Basin. It also doesn't have a balance sheet as strong as Chevron's. In 2020, Oxy slashed its dividend to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since brought it back up to $0.22, but the dividend isn't nearly as reliable as Chevron's. Chevron also has a higher yield at 4% compared to 1.8% for Oxy. Oxy would be stretched thin if oil prices tanked and could cut its dividend again, whereas Chevron's superior financial health would allow it to support its dividend even if its cash flow was negative in the short term. All told, Chevron is a better all-around buy than Oxy, but Oxy will likely outperform Chevron if oil prices go up because it has more to gain.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings A decisive win for Donald Trump eliminated any uncertainty around the results of the 2024 presidential election. But what Trump's second term means for investors is still up for debate. \"We think it’s fair to say that the US equity market is in a discovery process regarding the domestic policy platform of the new administration and that the political backdrop presents tailwinds and potential headwinds for stocks in the year ahead,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a 2025 outlook research note on Monday. Market action since Trump won the election on Nov 6. bears this out. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) soared 2.5% on the day after Trump's victory. Since then, the benchmark index has risen less than 1%. At one point, the S&P 500 had given back all of its post-election bump before rallying higher once more. Small caps, a popular Trump trade, surged after the election, with the Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) rising about 9% in the immediate aftermath. Then the trade reversed, with the index giving back over half its gains. Another swing saw the Russell 2000 hit a record intraday high on Monday. As Calvasina wrote: \"Right now we simply don’t know what the new administration will do in regard to their campaign promises, or the extent to which they will do them, adding to the fog.\" Another pillar of the Trump trade saw long-term Treasury yields rise, with investors fearing new tariffs would push inflation higher. News late Friday that the president-elect would nominate Scott Bessent to be the next Treasury secretary calmed some nerves, bringing the 10-year yield roughly back to where it stood on Election Day. In a note to clients on Monday, Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth cautioned against reading too much into Trump's Cabinet picks given \"uncertainty surrounding what policies president-elect Donald Trump will enact during his second term.\" Ashworth's comments get to the root of the market's issues right now: At the end of the day, campaign promises are just that, promises. During Trump's first term in office, nearly half of the 15 people he initially appointed to lead the executive departments were gone halfway through his presidency. In a note Monday issuing his 2025 year-end S&P 500 forecast of 6,600, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna opted not to include any impacts on how US policy shifts could impact earnings or valuations due to the \"fluidity of the Trump 2.0 policy outlook.\" \"[There] is a temptation to read a lot into [Trump's] Cabinet nominations, but we would caution against that,\" Capital Economics' Ashworth wrote. \"Following his comprehensive election victory this is Trump’s world, while the rest of us, including his cabinet, just live in it.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Wall Street's high-water mark for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) projects a nearly 17% increase from current levels at the end of 2025. On Monday, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha issued a year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, matching Yardeni Research's call as the most bullish among strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance. In explaining his thinking, Chadha highlighted the current strong macroeconomic backdrop in which unemployment has remained low while economic growth has proved resilient. \"For equities, strong equity inflows are partly driven by strong cyclical growth as it impacts views on prospective corporate earnings and equity returns,\" Chadha wrote. \"Inflows have also been driven by rising risk appetite which is currently very elevated. It certainly bears watching but risk appetite in our view should be high with the unemployment rate near 4% and GDP growth at 3%, a rare strong combination that has occurred just 6% of the time historically.\" Chadha added that prior periods with similar economic backdrops include the 1960s and the back half of the 1990s, which both saw \"strong equity performance.\" From a sector perspective, Chadha, like others on Wall Street issuing 2025 outlooks, is skeptical that the next leg higher in markets is led by megacap tech amid slowing earnings growth. Instead, he expects growth to \"continue rotating slowly in 2025\" and is leaning into areas he believes could benefit from continuing economic expansion. \"At the sector level, we maintain a cyclical tilt, remaining overweight the Financials where a multitude of tailwinds are converging, Consumer Cyclicals and Materials,\" Chadha wrote. While much of the focus in 2024 was on signs of slowing in the economy, Chadha's team sees a cycle where various aspects of expansion, like capital expenditure spending outside of tech, corporate confidence increases, and a pickup in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), are \"still to come.\" \"US capital markets and M&A activity has been running at low levels on persistent uncertainties around the business cycle, inflation, domestic politics and geopolitics,\" Chadha wrote. \"An unfavourable regulatory regime has also clearly been a drag. A combination of greater corporate confidence and an easier regulatory regime could spark a rebound in M&A and capital markets activity.\" Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni, who also sees the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 by the end of the year, told Yahoo Finance recently that part of that will be driven by a more pro-business Trump administration and the return of \"animal spirits.\" \"We're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,\" Yardeni told Yahoo Finance. \"And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed. And in addition to that, a lot of deregulation.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. \"The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with \"inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership,\" the S&P 500 should continue its march higher. Barclays' and RBC's targets are the latest forecasts from strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance and the latest that reinforce a general optimism on Wall Street that stocks will continue to rally next year. A highly debated component of these calls, however, has been whether or not 2025 will bring with it a continued broadening of returns outside the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks that led the first 18 months of the bull market rally. Calvasina argued that's the most likely case, falling in line with a recent call from Goldman Sachs that mega caps will see \"narrowing\" outperformance in 2025. Calvasina and her team cited growth as a \"crowded\" trade leading to the potential for more flows into the value side of the market, while also noting that valuations are more attractive outside of the large tech stocks. Additionally, the 2025 earnings outlook continues to point to a slowdown in earnings growth for large-cap tech, while the S&P 493 stocks are expected to see earnings growth accelerate. \"For Value to outperform, in recent years we’ve needed to see GDP run a bit hotter,\" said Calvasina, who sees GDP pacing in a range of 2.1% to 3% in 2025, above the current Bloomberg consensus of 2%. \"We’ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it’s a close call.\" Meanwhile, Krishna pointed to the most recent quarter of earnings reports in which Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) all topped Wall Street forecasts as a reason to believe investors might not be optimistic enough about Big Tech's earnings growth in 2025. \"Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year,\" Krishna wrote. Still, what that means for price returns in those stocks still remains to be seen. \"The last two earnings seasons have shown that headline EPS [earnings per share] beat-and-raises are not necessarily enough to drive additional share price upside amid concerns over the capital intensiveness of the next leg of growth, a consequence of the AI build out,\" Krishna wrote. \"We believe the potential upside from further AI uptake is not under appreciated, but it comes with a big question mark attached,\" Krishna added. The calls for stocks to run higher also haven't come without warning. RBC's Calvasina still sees an elevated likelihood of a 5%-10% drawdown occurring while the S&P 500 chugs higher to 6,600 at the end of next year. \"We have become increasingly worried about the possibility of a near-term 5-10% pullback in the S&P 500, primarily due to elevated positioning, recent froth in sentiment, and valuation that has gotten a little over its skis for 2024, which leave the S&P 500 vulnerable to bad news and perhaps simply in need of a breather,\" Calvasina wrote. A continued rise in 10-year Treasury yields, further dialing back of Federal Reserve rate cut expectations for 2025, and the rising strength of the US dollar are all headwinds Calvasina is closely tracking.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The post-election rally came to a halt earlier last week. However, markets have bounced back, hinting at yet another rally ahead of the all-important holiday season. Also, the fourth quarter has historically been great for stocks. This is likely to help Dow continue its northward journey. Given the positive sentiment, investors should bet on these three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and The Walt Disney Company DIS. These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market and assure good returns. On Monday, the Dow jumped 1% or 440.06 points to close at an all-time high of 44,736.57 points. This was the blue-chip index’s 45th record close this year. Although tech stocks have been primarily responsible for the broader rally, investors have lately been shifting focus to more economically sensitive corners of the market after the election. This has seen industrial and utility stocks gaining big, helping both the Dow and the S&P 500. Monday’s jump came as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is being seen as someone who would guide the economy into greener pastures without sparking inflation. Investors are hopeful about major reforms under Trump’s regime, including major tax cuts. The Dow rally gathered pace on Nov. 6, the day Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The blue-chip index added over 1,500 points to record its biggest single-day gain since November 2022 and the biggest post-election surge in 128 years. Following Trump's win, investors are expecting lower taxes and fewer regulations, as they see the new president as someone who openly addresses issues like the stock market and the value of the dollar. Also, investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will continue with its rate cuts, given that inflation is slowing and nearing its 2% goal. Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by a total of 75 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to a range of 4.5-4.75%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank need not be “in a hurry” to cut rates given the strength in the economy. However, market participants are still hopeful about another rate cut in December. Markets are pricing in a 56.2% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed in its December policy meeting. Amazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services. Amazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 79% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.3% over the last 60 days.

Disney (DIS) has agreed to pay $43 million to settle a lawsuit that it paid female employees less than their male counterparts in similar roles for nearly a decade. The settlement agreement, reached Monday, stems from a 2019 lawsuit filed by LaRonda Rasmussen. She claims she learned that six men with the same job title earned substantially more than her, including one man with several years less experience, who was earning $20,000 a year more than she did. About 9,000 women, who were both former and current employees, joined the lawsuit. Disney disputed the allegations and didn’t admit fault. “We have always been committed to paying our employees fairly and have demonstrated that commitment throughout this case, and we are pleased to have resolved this matter,” a spokesperson told CNN. As part of the settlement, Disney has to hire a labor economist to analyze pay equity among full-time, non-union California employees below the vice president level for three years, and fix the differences, the three law firms representing the plaintiffs said. “I strongly commend Ms. Rasmussen and the women who brought this discrimination suit against Disney, one of the largest entertainment companies in the world. They risked their careers to raise pay disparity at Disney,” Lori Andrus, a partner at Andrus Anderson, said in a statement. The plaintiffs accused Disney of paying female employees less than their male counterparts when they started at the company because their pay was lower at previous companies. Disney didn’t factor in their gender pay disparities, the Wall Street Journal noted. Disney said that a 2022 review of its pay policies revealed that women earned 99.4% of what men earned and that it the case shouldn’t be classified as a class action because pay is determined by hundreds of managers across several divisions at the sprawling company. The settlement agreement still requires approval by a judge. Reuters contributed to this report. For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com Sign in to access your portfolio",

                "title": "Mondelez, PepsiCo among companies dominating junk-food advertising before 9pm watershed, study says",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A handful of global confectionery and snacks giants, including Mondelez International and PepsiCo, have been pulled up for their record on TV advertising of unhealthy foods in the UK. The two companies, along with Mars, Haribo and Kellanova, were identified as accounting for 80% of all the TV advertising of confectionery and snacks before the 9pm watershed, when children are likely to be viewing before bedtime. London-based charity The Food Foundation, which campaigns for healthy diets, reported that those five manufacturers were among the 13 food and beverage companies advertising so-called HFSS products in the 5:30am to 9pm zone. That is a time period when “children are more likely to watch TV”, the Foundation said in its annual State of the Nation’s Food Industry report for 2024, adding that Haribo and Mars were the biggest culprits among the five standouts – 25% and 20%, respectively, in terms of the share of adverts concerned. The data was provided by the University of Liverpool but was based on an analysis from July to August 2022. That preceded the change of government in the UK, although Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged, among the party’s key mandates, to stamp out advertising of so-called junk foods. During its reign, the Conservative Party had pushed back a ban on the advertising of junk, or unhealthy foods, before the watershed threshold to October 2025, as the cost-of-living crunch took hold. Rules banning multi-buy deals on foods and drinks high in fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS), including buy-one-get-one-free deals, were also delayed until that time. It did, however, implement a ban on displays of unhealthy foods at retailer checkouts and end-of-aisle promotions in 2023 amid a general push in the UK to cut obesity rates, particularly in children. Labour has said it will honour those October 2025 commitments. Rebecca Tobi, the senior business and investor engagement manager at The Food Foundation, urged the Labour government to take up the baton. “If we are to have any chance of ensuring the next generation are the healthiest ever – as Labour have pledged – then we simply can’t continue to ignore the major role large food companies are playing in shaping UK diets. \"We urgently need the government to introduce regulation to raise standards and create a level playing field that enables progressive businesses to go further, faster.” The Food Foundation suggested the five confectionery and snacks companies pulled up in the report have marketing policies not to advertise products to children but claimed those same policies were not being honoured. It noted: “The discrepancy between these company commitments and the large number of ads aired before the watershed suggests there is a disconnect between their marketing policies and what happens in practice. “Even where ads or media are not explicitly targeting children, the timing of these adverts coincides with those times when children are more likely to be watching TV and are likely to be exposing children to HFSS product advertising.” Just Food asked the five major confectionery and snacks producers cited in the report to comment on the two-year-old data. Haribo coined its response with respect to a recent comment from the UK food industry body, the Food and Drink Federation, of which it is a member. “Our industry adheres to all advertising rules, including those which restrict the advertising of less healthy food around children’s media. Companies are also preparing for further regulations that come into effect in October 2025. \"We’re calling for government and regulators to move swiftly to publish the regulations and industry guidance so that we have sufficient time to prepare.\" Mars said via a UK spokesperson: “We understand the responsibility we have to help our consumers enjoy our products as part of a healthy and balanced diet. A key part of this is our commitment to young people. “Our Q3 2022 audit results for UK TV show that we were 99.2% compliant with our audience threshold commitment.” A spokesperson for Kellanova acknowledged the data in the report is “outdated” and that the company is “fully committed to the responsible marketing of our foods”. Kellanova added: “As of January 2023, TV and digital advertising for our brands, such as Kellogg’s and Pringles, is for an over 16 target audience. This means that we don’t advertise high fat, high sugar, high salt foods on TV to under 16s.\" Baroness Walmsley, the chair of the House of Lords Food Diet and Obesity Committee, was cited by the Foundation as saying: “The government should act now to develop a long-term strategy to fix our food system, underpinned by a new legislative framework. “Without it, businesses have insufficient incentive to act in the public interest and will continue to cause harm with their relentless promotion of junk food.” \"Mondelez, PepsiCo among companies dominating junk-food advertising before 9pm watershed, study says\" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.

Pepsi is making another pitch as the superior soft drink pairing with burgers with new “Undercover Cups” stunt videos, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The guerilla-style marketing sees Pepsi agents barge into locations of the three largest U.S. burger chains to snag customers’ drinks and replace them with Pepsi. McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s have official partnerships with rival Coca-Cola. “Undercover Cups,” a pun on undercover cops, is running on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, X and TikTok. Pepsi stepping up its tit-for-tat marketing with competitors follows the brand losing its spot as the No. 2 soda in the U.S. Pepsi has made food pairings a focus of its marketing for several years, but “Undercover Cups” sees the brand return to more direct shots across the bow at its biggest competitor — along with the fast food chains that exclusively carry Coke products. “Undercover Cups” builds on a “Pepsi Chase Cars” campaign released in September that depicts Pepsi agents chasing down pizza delivery drivers to add Pepsi to their orders in the nick of time. Pepsi’s crack team is back in “Undercover Cups,” as is a brand-themed sports car kitted out with fountain machines for serving up ice-cold soda on the go. In the new social content, Pepsi agents barge into McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s locations, swapping out diners’ soft drink orders with Pepsi and inspiring surprised — and in some cases, expletive-filled — reactions from customers and store managers. Bloopers and cut-downs of the video will be shared on social media. The replacement fountain cups featured in “Undercover Cups” toy with McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s iconography. One shows the Wendy’s mascot sipping on soda, her signature red hair turned Pepsi-blue, while another sandwiches the phrase “This is Pepsi” into the Burger King logo. BBDO is the creative agency behind the concept that argues “Burgers deserve Pepsi.” “Undercover Cups” lands ahead of National Fast-Food Day on Nov. 16, when DoorDash customers can receive $5 off an order that includes Pepsi from participating restaurants Fatburger, KFC and Taco Bell. DoorDash was also a partner on “Pepsi Chase Cars.” Pepsi in 2021 debuted a #BetterwithPepsi platform with a campaign that similarly riffed on McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s imagery and ribbed their preference for Coke. #BetterwithPepsi evolved over the years to position Pepsi as the ideal drink for meals like pizza, hot dogs and cookout food. “Pepsi Chase Cars” and “Undercover Cups” are part of a Food Deserves Pepsi platform that appears largely the same, but with a heavier bent toward candid-camera marketing that aims to go viral. #BetterwithPepsi was the brainchild of former Pepsi CMO Todd Kaplan, who departed the CPG giant for Kraft Heinz earlier this year. “Pepsi Chase Cars” proved a hit with consumers, racking up over 5 million views on YouTube. Keeping Pepsi in the online conversation will be important as the brand vies for the dollars of price-conscious shoppers and fights to win back market share. Dr Pepper surpassed Pepsi as the No. 2 soft drink in the U.S. in June, according to Beverage Digest data.

                "title": "The road to net zero – Big Food’s emissions pledges",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this guide, you will see food manufacturers linking their net zero targets to three areas of emissions – Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Under the internationally-recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an organisation’s emissions are split into three ‘scopes’. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. A second, Scope 2, covers indirect emissions from the generation of the electricity, steam, heating and cooling bought and consumed by a reporting organisation. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain – and are the largest chunk in a food manufacturer’s output. The world’s biggest food manufacturer detailed its net-zero plans in 2020, a year after committing to be greenhouse gas emissions-free by 2050. Then CEO Mark Schneider described the move as a “moral obligation, a moral commitment here to make good on preserving the planet we all live on and, at the same time, it’s about staying relevant to the consumer”. Nestlé, which had its emissions reduction targets approved by the SBTi, has a target to reduce emissions by 20% by 2025, from its baseline of 2018, and then by 50% by 2030. (The company says it emitted 113 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018, which was its baseline for measuring progress). The group’s moves to get to net zero have included investment in regenerative agriculture, moves to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025 and a bid to source “renewable electricity” at all sites by the same year. In Nestlé’s 2022 annual report, the Swiss giant said its emissions had fallen below the 2018 baseline. In June 2023, Nestlé set out plans to stop using carbon offsets and withdraw its pledges to make certain brands ‘carbon neutral’. The company had previously issued ‘carbon neutral’ targets for brands including KitKat and Nespresso coffee, In October of the same year, a report by The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (the NGO with which many of the world’s largest FMCG companies signed up to a plan that carried a headline pledge that 100% of plastic packaging would be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025) issued a progress report on the companies’ efforts. According to the EMF, Nestlé reduced its use of virgin plastic use by 10% between 2018 and 2022. However, the share of the company’s plastic packaging that was reusable, recyclable and compostable decreased from 55% to 51% over the same four-year period, the NGO reported. In May 2023, Nestlé’s international cereal venture with General Mills, Cereal Partners Worldwide, set out its target to be net zero by 2050. First, CPW wants to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. By 2025, 13% of CPW’s cereals will come from “regenerative agricultural practices”, the Cheerios marketer said. The venture said it had worked with Quantis, an external consultant, to conduct a life-cycle assessment and help it “prioritise the actions it needed to accelerate and introduce and set science-based targets”. The goals have also been reviewed by the SBTi. In March 2024, Nestlé said it had achieved a net reduction of 13.5% of its GHG emissions in 2023 compared to its 2018 baseline, while continuing to grow its business over the same period. This included delivering a reduction of more than 15.3% in methane emissions. The company said it has successfully decoupled its growth from its emissions and is on track to reach a 20% absolute reduction of GHG emissions by 2025. It said that these \"significant reductions\" in GHG emissions come from programmes and initiatives implemented across all three scopes of activities (scope 1, 2 and 3). In 2023, 94% of the decline of Nestlé's GHG emissions came from reductions in its operations and supply chain. Antonia Wanner, group head of ESG strategy and deployment, said \"Our progress on emissions reductions is proof of our unwavering commitment to our net zero roadmap. We are working closely with our partners to help make food production more sustainable, while aiming at enhancing livelihoods across our value chain at the same time. A just transition is crucial to accelerate our efforts.\" The US food and beverage giant’s emissions targets are as follows: to cut “absolute greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain” by more than 40% by 2030, which includes a 75% reduction in emissions “from our direct operations”; and to “achieve net-zero emissions by 2040”. Those targets are based on a 2015 baseline. In a progress report issued in June 2024, PepsiCo said it had cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 33% against that 2015 criteria. By contrast, Scope 3 emissions had dropped by 1%. “Delivering our products requires certain key inputs and activities whose emissions we cannot always control or influence. This may contribute to emissions related to the crops that make up our products, the packaging that holds them and parts of the transportation system that delivers them to our customers,” the Pepsi Max and Gatorade brands owner stated. “We know that turning the tide will take diligence and time, but we are laying the foundation by putting substantial support and investment behind climate action and building resilience in our own operations.” Combining the reduction across the Scopes meant PepsiCo had lowered its total emissions by 4% by the end of 2023 compared to 2015. PepsiCo has also set itself a target of “regenerative agriculture practices” being used on 7m acres of land used “to grow our crops and ingredients for our products” by 2030. In 2023, more than 1.8 million acres were using the practices, up from more than 900,000 in 2022. Meanwhile, by 2030, the Lay’s maker wants to “sustainably source 100% of our key ingredients”, a list that will include not just the potatoes, corn and oats used for the company’s snacks and cereal “but also key crops from third parties, such as vegetable oils and grains”. In 2023, the proportion of ingredients meeting that benchmark stood at around 58%, PepsiCo said, up from 55% a year earlier. On packaging, PepsiCo has a “per serving” target. The company is aiming to cut its use of virgin plastic from non-renewable sources “per serving across our global beverages and convenient foods portfolio by 50%” by 2030 against a 2020 baseline. In 2023, the level had fallen by 1%. A year earlier, PepsiCo’s use had actually gone up by 2%. By 2030, PepsiCo wants to reduce “our absolute tonnage of virgin plastic derived from non-renewable sources” by 20%, again versus a 2020 baseline. In 2023, that amount was 6% higher. “Business growth in certain markets, particularly in markets that do not allow, or have only recently allowed, rPET in food grade packaging, has presented challenges to virgin plastic reduction,” the company said. The snacks heavyweight committed to a 2050 net-zero emissions target across its full value chain in November 2021. Mondelez said at the time the new pledge was built on its science-based targets set out in 2020. The Cadbury chocolate owner said it planned to lay down “time-bound” interim goals over the next two years in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement, adding it will monitor progress annually across scopes 1-3. Early in 2020, the US food manufacturer updated its emissions goals to seek a further 10% reduction across its manufacturing operations by 2025. At the time, the Oreo maker said it was on target to meet its initial objective of a 15% cut by the end of that year as it sought to extend the company’s objectives across the supply chain, or Scope 3 emissions. In November 2021, Mondelez said it was ahead of target with a 24% reduction in CO2 emissions from manufacturing last year, along with a 33% cut in water usage, compared to its goal of 10%. Total waste was also cut by 31% versus a target of 20%. Mondelez said it will continue to convert its global manufacturing electricity footprint to renewable energy and replace thermal fuels such as natural gas, diesel and gasoline with green alternatives. “While we’ve already made significant progress, the road to net-zero will require further transformation of our business as well as global collaboration across industries, sectors and landscapes,” Chris McGrath, the vice president and chief of sustainability at Mondelez, said in November 2021. “We will remain focused on leveraging proven models and available solutions, while at the same time using our scale and influence to help drive technical advancement, public-private collaboration and investment to incubate innovation.” In February 2024, Mondelez announced it was to invest €5m ($5.4m then) in the energy efficiency of its Milka chocolate plant in Austria. The US snack giant said it planned to add heat pumps that could reduce the gas consumption of the “traditional chocolate factory” by 65%. The move was part of Mondelez’s efforts to install “energy-efficient technologies” and increase its use of renewable energies. The group’s 2022 ESG report stated that some 39% of the energy used at its manufacturing facilities that year was generated from renewable sources, up from 32% a year earlier. Mondelez is aiming to use only renewable electricity across its manufacturing sites by 2030. The 2022 ESG report reinforced the company's ambition to, reduce end-to-end CO2emissions by 10% by 2025. To coincide with the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November 2021, Grupo Bimbo announced its own net-zero commitment. The bakery manufacturer set a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company, generally considered to be the world’s largest bakery business, said the roadmap towards this commitment had been “carefully defined”. Bimbo identified three intermediate goals on the path towards net zero: eliminating Scope 2 emissions by 2025, as well as reducing 50% of Scope 1 and 28% of Scope 3 by 2030. The group’s initiatives include switching to 100% renewable energy, moving to lower carbon logistics and vehicles, implementing energy efficiency strategies and supporting suppliers and partners in reducing their emissions through technological innovation. Just Food analysis: Food giants need to pick up pace on greenhouse gas emissions Mars is a company that has had more than one attempt at setting emissions targets. In September 2023, the privately-owned group issued a fresh set of net-zero pledges. There was no change to its net-zero commitment, which stayed consistent with its initial pledge. However, what was new was the addition of an SBTI-approved 2030 target. It was the second time in under two years the US giant had updated its pledges on emissions. The M&Ms sweets owner wants to cut carbon emissions by 50% – or by roughly 15m metric tons – by 2030 across its full value chain. The new target, reviewed by the SBTi, is linked to a 2015 baseline. Mars had pledged to lower emissions by 27% by 2025 against the 2015 baseline in 2017, in line with the 2 degree target that was advocated for at the time – before a 1.5 degree target was widely accepted. In October 2021, it announced its intention to achieve net zero line with the 1.5 degree or below target. However, the company said in September 2023 it had only achieved an 8% reduction – worth 2.6m metric tons – while “growing the business 60% in that time”. The October 2021 announcement saw Mars set a new accelerated target to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2050, an update on a previous pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 67% by 2050. Back in 2009, Mars had set a target for its direct operations to reach net-zero by 2040. Danone has set a target for zero net carbon emissions by 2050. Back in 2008, Danone announced a plan to reduce its “carbon intensity” by 30% over five years on operations within its direct scope of responsibility – an objective the company says it “achieved and exceeded” at the end of 2012. Three years later, the food and beverage manufacturer announced a target for zero net carbon emissions “within its full scope”, which also included agriculture. The French food giant said the pledge means it would be covering “the full scope of its carbon footprint”, which in 2014 amounted to 18.8 million tons. Danone, home to brands including Activia and Actimel, set out a target to cut “carbon intensity” by 50% between 2015 and 2030. It also committed to starting to reduce emissions in absolute terms before 2025. At the time, then CEO Emmanuel Faber said: “Our activities are directly linked to nature and agriculture. The risks of global warming are high and they affect both the natural cycles on which we depend and people's living conditions, starting with family farmers and livestock breeders. Today we have decided to go much further and we are adopting another decisive step for a resilient growth model.” Two years later, Danone set two interim targets, approved by the SBTi, to: one, reduce its emissions intensity by 50% across all three Scopes between 2015 and 2030; and, two, cut its absolute emissions by 30% on Scopes 1 and 2 between 2015 and 2030. In September 2019, Danone signed the “Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge” at the UN Climate Summit, undertaking to reach its peak emissions in 2020. Danone said that pledge “represents a significant acceleration of Danone’s GHG emission reduction targets, across scope 1, 2 and 3”. In February 2020, the Alpro maker unveiled a EUR2bn (then US$2.19bn) war-chest for spending on sustainability initiatives. According to Danone’s 2020 universal registration document, the company’s total emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent for Scopes 1 and 2 decreased by 12.4% between 2019 and 2020. The group said that was “mainly due to purchases of electricity from renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements. On a like-for-like basis, these emissions decreased by 11.5% compared to 2019 and 38.1% compared to 2015”. The report stated that in 2020 Danone’s Scope 3 emissions were 24,974ktCO2eq, compared to 25,869ktCO2eq a year earlier. Faber had been one of the CEOs at the vanguard of efforts among ‘Big Food’ to do business more sustainably. In 2021, amid mounting pressure from some investors, he stood down as chief executive but stayed on as chairman. Just a fortnight later, Danone’s board decided Faber should leave the business entirely as investor criticism of the French group’s strategy continued. At the end of the year, it was announced Faber would become chair of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), set up by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. The foundation already houses the International Accounting Standards Board, which issues the International Financial Reporting Standards, a set of accounting rules for the financial disclosures of public companies. The new ISSB is setting out to develop “a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure standards to meet investors’ information needs”. In 2022, Danone set a target of cutting the methane emissions generated by the fresh milk used in its products by 30% by 2030. Methane emissions represented 25% of Danone’s full scope emissions, the company said at the time. Fresh milk accounted for approximately 70% of Danone’s methane emissions. The remaining 30% was made up by indirect dairy ingredients. In January 2023, Danone confirmed it intends to cut the methane emissions generated by the fresh milk used in its products by 30% by 2030. It said it expects to remove 1.2 million tonnes of the carbon dioxide equivalent of methane emissions. The company said it had cut its methane emissions by “circa 14%” in the 2018 to 2020 period. Danone revealed it had launched a new partnership with the US-based organisation Environmental Defense Fund to help with its efforts on methane and would work with farmers, other companies and governments on regenerative practices to help it cut methane emissions. In November 2023, Danone partnered with the Global Methane Hub (GMH) to invest in research around the reduction of enteric emissions in its dairy farming. The dairy giant said it will be “the first corporate funder” of GMH’s “globally coordinated” Enteric Fermentation R&D Accelerator. The project intends to develop scalable solutions to help farmers limit enteric fermentation, a digestive process occurring in ruminant livestock which releases methane into the atmosphere. In September 2024, Danone and Japan-based food manufacturer Ajinomoto Group joined forces to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the French giant’s milk collection network. Danone signed up to use AjiPro-L, a supplement used in cow feed, at the farms from which it collects milk. In November 2024, Danone joined forces with shipping and logistics giant Maersk in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its ocean freight operations. As part of the collaboration, the French dairy major planned to leverage Maersk’s ECO Delivery Ocean service, a “sustainable shipping solution” powered by reduced-GHG-emission fuels such as biodiesel and bio-methanol. France’s Bel Group has set out to reduce emissions by “one-quarter” by 2035 across the dairy firm’s value chain. The owner of the Babybel and Laughing Cow cheese brands said in February 2022 it joined the SBTi in 2017 when the global objective was to keep global warming below 2C. Its new commitment for Scopes 1, 2 and 3, will involve the “integration of carbon tracking as a tool for steering its activities”. A spokesperson for Bel, which also produces dairy-free and hybrid cheeses, confirmed the company set out plans in 2019 to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42% versus 2017 levels by 2030 – “in metric ton CO2 eq./metric ton produced” – and cut Scope 3 emissions by 27% over the same time frame and the same benchmark year. “Based on our previous trajectory and by working with business experts, we have reviewed our goals to create a more ambitious action plan to help us reach 1.5°C,” the spokesperson said. “Greenhouse gas emissions at the group’s industrial sites come mainly from the energy mix and the processes used to manufacture its products. The group is tackling sources of emissions to reduce the carbon intensity of its production to move toward carbon neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. From 2008 to 2020, we reduced our carbon emission from 60% on scopes 1 and 2.” Bel will pursue initiatives to reduce its energy consumption and energy efficiency at its production sites and also use and develop renewable energy sources. The spokesperson added Bel has defined other objectives and considerations: “What we are already doing (decarbonisation plan for our plants, European feed for dairy cows and grazing for our French breeders, evaluation of the carbon footprint of dairy farms, and a carbon reduction process with all stakeholders in the chain). “What we believe and anticipate (our economic development, dairy/plant-based rebalancing) [and] the bets we are making on the future with technological breakthroughs such as hydrogen transport.” Bel declined to provide details on its success in cutting emissions to date until the new objectives are certified by the SBTi. The spokesperson added with respect to Bel’s investment plans to achieve its targets that it is “hard to quantify in its entirety, since it is distributed across all of our departments”. However, “since 2018 and since 2020, we have invested more than €50m (US$56.5m) to support our French breeders in the transformation of the dairy sector; nearly €69 million was invested between 2009 and 2020 to reduce Bel’s environmental footprint”. Bel emphasised it is working with dairy farm suppliers to “develop more sustainable farming practices”. Chairman and CEO Antoine Fiévet said: “Our new +1.5°C trajectory will have a significant impact, for everyone. It involves our employees as well as all our stakeholders, from our upstream dairy operations to the consumer.” In August 2023, Bel launched the Sustainable Purchasing Charter which demands of its suppliers that they \"continuously develop and improve an environmental management system which minimises their impacts on the environment and reduces energy and water consumption, CO2 emissions, as well as consumption of non-renewable natural resources or non-eco-friendly products\". Suppliers must also promote the development of environmentally-friendly agriculture and technologies and make their best efforts in the innovation process to offer products with the lowest possible environmental impact throughout their life cycle. Dutch dairy major FrieslandCampina is aiming to “produce net climate-neutral dairy by no later than 2050”. The co-operative has laid out emissions targets for 2030. Against a 2015 baseline, it has a goal of cutting its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 63%. FrieslandCampina has divided its Scope 3 emissions in two classifications. By 2030, the company is aiming to reduce Scope 3 emissions from milk from its member dairy farmers by a third against that 2015 base year. FrieslandCampina says it is targeting a 43% reduction in its “other” Scope 3 emissions, including raw materials and packaging. Announcing the targets in April 2022, the group said its moves to reduce emissions were “well underway”. It pointed to a 28% cut in its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions between 2015 and 2021. Hein Schumacher, CEO at the time, said: “Our detailed climate plan demonstrates that we are keen to do our bit. Our targets and concrete actions provide a clear road map towards a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, putting us on course to achieve net climate-neutral dairy by 2050.” The dairy group joined the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition (DSGC), a group of Dutch multinationals that work towards sustainable development. The coalition is supported by the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW) and the Royal Association MKB-Nederland for small and medium-sized businesses. It also belongs to the BICEPS Network, which works towards cleaner sea transport through innovation and conditions for suppliers. The US-based manufacturer of brands such as Betty Crocker, Pillsbury and Old El Paso pledged in September 2020 to reduce emissions by 30% over the next decade. General Mills has also committed to a longer-term goal to achieve net-zero emission levels by 2050. The US-based manufacturer said the commitment was calculated using methodologies approved by the SBTi. As of the end of General Mills’ 2020 fiscal year, the company says its “GHG emissions footprint had decreased 16% compared to our 2010 baseline”. It said it accomplished this by using energy more efficiently across its owned facilities and by converting to less greenhouse gas-intensive forms of energy. General Mills is to work with farmers and suppliers to address “key growing dimensions including GHG emission reduction, water management, and soil health in an effort to establish more climate-resilient farms”. In its 2023 Global Responsibility Report, General Mills announced that through fiscal 2022 it reduced emissions by 1% across its entire value chain compared to the 2020baseline. \"Within our owned operations, however, we have reduced emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 26% compared to last year and 49% compared to our 2020 baseline. These reductions were driven by continued progress in our commitment to sourcing renewable electricity, improvements in operational waste disposal and reduced purchasing requirements,\" it said. It added: \"Scope 3 emissions remain a challenge to our full value chain progress. That is why we are in the process of developing an enhanced climate roadmap to ensure we continue to see emissions reductions at a rate that will achieve our 2030 and 2050 goals.\" In March 2021, Brazilian meat giant JBS committed to net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2040. The meat sector has long been under scrutiny for the emissions it generates and JBS claimed to be “the first major company in its sector to set a net-zero target”. The pledge spans the company’s global operations, including Pilgrim’s Pride in the US and Moy Park in the UK, as well as its supply chain of agricultural producers, suppliers and customers. As part of JBS’ commitment, the company signed on to the United Nations Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative, which aligns with the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. JBS said it will provide a “time-bound roadmap” that provides interim targets consistent with the criteria set forth by the UN’s 1.5°C trajectory. The company plans to provide annual updates on progress to ensure transparency and disclose its financial risks linked to climate change, in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) initiative. To get to net-zero, JBS outlined plans to invest more than US$1bn over the next decade in emission reduction projects and to eliminate deforestation from its global supply chain by 2035. On emissions from facilities, JBS said it will cut its “global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission intensity by at least 30% by 2030 against [the] base year 2019”. JBS is also set a target to use only renewable electricity in its facilities by 2040. And it said it will invest in research and development projects to assist producer efforts in regenerative farming, including carbon sequestration and on-farm emission mitigation technologies. In July 2021, JBS said it had advanced by five years the date by which it wants to see zero deforestation by its suppliers in a number of domestic regions. It now wants to end deforestation in the supply chain by 2025 in the Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes, matching a previously-announced commitment for the Amazon. In February 2024, New York state launched legal action against JBS's US operation over allegations of environmental claims that deceive customers. State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the group’s US arm. James called on the New York County Supreme Court to demand JBS drops its 2040 net-zero pledge. Within the filing, James claimed the company has “repeatedly and persistently made unsubstantiated and misleading environmental marketing claims to New York consumers”. Responding to the claim in a statement, JBS said it took its sustainability goals “very seriously”. Just Food analysis: Total responsibility, partial control: the food company’s climate conundrum Unilever has been seen as among the companies to have set the pace on corporate sustainability. The FMCG giant's Sustainable Living Plan, launched way back in 2010, set sustainability targets seen as ambitious and aimed to “decouple” growth from environmental impact. The plan set out around 50 social, economic and environmental targets, including a bid to halve the greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste used by the company in its direct operations, and by its suppliers and consumers. The Sustainable Living Plan was a ten-year project. By 2020, Unilever had outlined a new target for its carbon emissions among measures the Hellmann’s mayonnaise maker said underlined it was “taking even more decisive action” on the environment. Unilever said it would aim to have no carbon emissions from its operations and to “halve the greenhouse-gas footprint of our products across the value chain” by 2030. The company added it was “committing to net zero emissions from all our products by 2039 – from the sourcing of the materials we use, up to the point of sale of our products in the store”. In March 2024, the company set out what it described as new \"higher ambition\" climate emission goals, including near-term Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for the first time. Unilever said it had already \"succeeded in reducing emissions in our operations by 74% in absolute terms versus 2015\" and also pointed to a 21% cut \"in the emissions intensity of our products across our value chain\" against a 2010 baseline. However, the company conceded \"achieving significant absolute reductions in our Scope 3 emissions has proven more challenging\". Specifically, Unilever wants to reduce in absolute terms its operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 base year. The company set out specific groups of Scope 3 emissions it wants to target. By 2030, Unilever is aiming to reduce its “energy and industrial GHG emissions” by 42% versus 2021. Unilever defined these Scope 3 emissions as those from: purchased goods and services (associated with ingredients, packaging); upstream transport anddistribution, energy and fuel-related activities; direct emissions from use of sold products; (those linked to HFC propellants); the end-of-life treatment of sold products and downstream leased assets (those associated with ice cream retail cabinets). Elsewhere, the company set a target for Scope 3 greenhouse-gas emissions from forest, land and agriculture. These cover emissions from purchased goods and services associated with ingredients. Unilever is targeting cutting these emissions by 30.3% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. Together, the two targets for 2030 represent a 39% absolute reduction in Scope 3 emissions, the company said. By 2039, Unilever wants to achieve net zero GHG emissions covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3, \"excluding indirect consumer use emissions\". In a joint statement, Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher and chair Ian Meakins said: “The challenges of the climate transition are clear, especially if the world is to reduce GHG emissions at a pace consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, avoiding the worst effects of climate change.\" In 2017, Kraft Heinz – formed two years before with the merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz – released its inaugural CSR report, which included a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2020 (per ton of product, as measured against a 2015 baseline). In the company’s 2021 ESG report, it disclosed it had in fact managed to lower its GHG emissions by 8.56% – while also missing targets on water use, energy and waste. Kraft Heinz said it had failed to meet the targets as it “contended with former supply chain challenges”. Water use decreased by 0.02%, energy use decreased by 2.69%, while GHG emissions decreased by 8.56%. In its 2021 ESG report, Kraft Heinz said: “We recognise the shortcomings in our execution in these areas and we have both identified and learned from the gaps, as well as committed to substantially improve in these areas in part through greater accountability, prioritisation and real-time management. Our more comprehensive approach is paying off with our new targets.” In December 2021, the baked beans and soup manufacturer unveiled a fresh set of targets. Kraft Heinz announced a pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all three Scopes by 2050. The company also set out a “milestone” on that pledge; it is targeting a reduction of 50% across all three Scopes by 2030. Kraft Heinz is planning to set a science-based emissions reduction target, in alignment with the SBTi, by 2023. The same year, the company says it plans to provide more information on its “roadmap” to net-zero emissions by 2050. In July 2023, Kraft Heinz announced it had adopted a policy to end deforestation in its supply chain. The company committed to no-deforestation across its primary commodities with a target date of 2025. Kraft Heinz said the policy has been developed with guidance from the Accountability Framework initiative and the Science Based Target Initiative’s forest, land and agriculture guidance. In February 2024, Kraft Heinz what it calls “an important step forward” in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The company signed an agreement with Carlton Power, a UK energy infrastructure development company, to explore the potential development of a 20MW green hydrogen plant at its Kitt Green manufacturing facility in Wigan in north-west England. Carlton Power projects director Eric Adams said the move is significant as “other food companies wishing to decarbonise their operations, could follow the example of Kraft Heinz”. One of the largest food processing plants in Europe, Kitt Green produces 250,000 tonnes of food annually, including Heinz’ famous baked beans. In July 2022, the US meat giant released its 2021 Sustainability Report which it said reflects the company’s “continued focus on supporting its people and communities, driving product responsibility and working to sustain natural resources”. John Tyson, EVP strategy and chief sustainability officer, said: “More than ever, Tyson Foods is operating as part of a global food system and we have a critical role to play in responsibly producing food that is affordable, accessible and nutritious.” The Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm brands owner said that in 2021 it had begun a process to further establish long-range 2030 goals and metrics that will “help more deeply embed its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities and commitments into its business”. Its commitments - Working Toward Sustaining Natural Resources and Achieving Net Zero - include \"driving practices in its own operations and supply chains to sustainably produce protein for a growing population within planetary boundaries\". It announced an ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, by 2050 In the land stewardship area, it said it had developed a beef-focused GHG emissions accounting framework to “capture cradle-to-gate emissions and verify emission reductions through more sustainable agricultural practices”. US packaged food major Campbell Soup Co. announced in March 2022 new science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of its overall environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy outlined in its 2022 corporate responsibility report. Campbell’s targets commit to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 42% by fiscal 2030 from a fiscal 2020 base year and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution 25% within the same time frame. Mark Clouse, Campbell’s CEO, said: “We are taking a holistic approach to ESG and focusing on areas where we believe we can make a meaningful difference as we unlock our full growth potential and create value for all our stakeholders.” The company’s corporate responsibility report revealed it has improved the sustainability of its packaging, with Pepperidge Farm signature paper bags now fully recyclable and redesigned V8 multi-serve bottles to eliminate 2.5 million pounds of plastic per year. Campbell has also transitioned 100% ofits palm oil supply to Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sources. US canned fruit and vegetable manufacturer Del Monte Foods announced in April 2022 a commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 in line with the SBTi's Net-Zero Standard. It has also committed to near-term science-based targets to reduce Scopes 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions. The company describes its plan as “a clearly defined and measurable path to not only achieve its long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but also drive near-term and consistent progress for reducing emissions across its supply chain”. Greg Longstreet, the company’s president and CEO, said: “As Growers of Good, creating a healthy and more hopeful tomorrow has been at the core of Del Monte Foods' purpose for over 130 years. Committing to a net-zero emissions goal, aligned with SBTi, extends our environmental sustainability commitments and gives us aggressive and measurable milestones to reach as we strive to nourish the planet, people and communities for many generations to come.” To achieve its net-zero goal, Del Monte Foods plans to reduce or eliminate the majority of its existing emissions rather than purchase external carbon credits to offset emissions. Sweden-based confectionery group Cloetta announced in July 2022 it had set climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of the Paris agreement. The targets have now been approved by the SBTi. It has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions within Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Henri de Sauvage-Nolting, CEO of Cloetta, said: “Setting ambitious climate targets requires a step-change in the way we as a company address our actions and responsibility for our climate footprint. It will encourage and require collaboration throughout our entire company and supply chain.\" Cloetta said it aims to achieve its targets by eliminating high-impact greenhouse gases from products and improving efficiency throughout its operations and supply chain. It also intends to invest in a new sustainable greenfield facility in the Netherlands. In March 2024, it published its Annual and Sustainability Report 2023 which revealed total CO2e emissions decreased with approximately 10% compared to its 2019 base-year. CEO Henri de Sauvage-Nolting said: \"Last year, we made further progress within our climate action programme by improving our data collection process through collaboration with value chain partners for our scope 3 emissions and structured our initiatives to accelerate the reduction of our scope 1 and 2 emissions.\" In July 2023, New Zealand dairy heavyweight Fonterra announced a \"lift in its decarbonisation ambition\" with a new Scope 1&2 emissions reduction target which it said will be achieved by bringing forward some of its work to get out of coal. Fonterra CEO Miles Hurrell said the co-op is targeting a 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1&2 emissions by 2030, from a 2018 baseline, an increase on its previous target of a 30% reduction by 2030. “Fonterra’s Scope 1&2 emissions largely come from our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Strengthening our emissions reduction target supports our ambition to be net zero by 2050,” he said. Achieving the new target will require Fonterra to continue to undertake energy efficiency improvements and fuel switching to renewable energy source activities across its milk collection fleet and manufacturing sites, with a focus on the six where it uses coal. To do this, Fonterra is to receive a government contribution of up to NZ$90m ($55.8m), via its Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) fund, which will contribute to the company's forecasted investment of NZ$790m in the project. Hurrell said: \"As a co-op, Fonterra understands how we can achieve more by working together. The addition of government funding enables us to lift our 2030 ambition to reduce Scope 1&2 emissions by 50% and optimise our process to get out of coal by 2037. “Our decarbonisation plan will see us explore multiple technologies to ensure the most efficient phase out of coal and transition to renewable energy across our manufacturing sites, while building resilience into our operations. “We are already well underway with shifting our manufacturing operations to renewable energy sources. Over the past five years, we have carried out decarbonisation projects at five different sites and we’re looking forward to continuing this momentum.\" In November 2023, the company also set a goal to hit 30% \"intensity reduction\" in its farm-related emissions by 2030. The new target will look to cut emissions intensity by tonne of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) collected by Fonterra. Some 86% of its emissions are said to currently come from its member farms. To hit the target, the organisation said it will work towards a 7% reduction through sharing “farming best practices” around feed quality and herd performance. An additional 7% of emissions will also be cut through implementing “novel technologies” via AgriZeroNZ – a joint venture between large agribusiness companies and the government. It also plans to cut 8% of emissions by removing carbon from current and new vegetation and an extra 8% from “historical land-use change conversions to dairy.” In December 2023, Swiss chocolatier Lindt & Sprüngli announced science-based climate targets. It said it is targeting carbon reductions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050. The company launched near- and long-term science-based emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative. The Kilchberg-headquartered business is targeting intermediate carbon reductions of 42% – Scope 1 and 2 – and 30.3% – Scope 3 – by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050. Lindt & Sprüngli’s targets have been verified by the SBTi. Most of the emissions in the company’s carbon footprint, comprising around 95%, come from Scope 3-related activities, meaning activities not under its direct operational control. Cocoa, other raw materials such as dairy and sugar, transport and packaging are the biggest contributors to its footprint. Lindt & Sprüngli said it will prioritise decarbonisation efforts and neutralise all residual emissions to reach the net-zero goal. In November 2024, UK meat and seafood major Hilton Food Group published its first transition plan to achieve net-zero by 2048. The plan, which encourages its partners to align to its strategy and deliver their own sustainability goals, is said to be aligned with the UK Government’s Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) disclosure framework. The company said its plans have be tailored to the specific needs of each of its sites, accounting for local technology, weather conditions and energy demand, and designed in collaboration with customers to measure and reduce theenvironmental impact of products across the value chain. Hilton's plan is built on its Science-Based Targets, approved in March 2024, with plans to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions accelerated earlier this year. Its reduction targets are focused on business operations, packaging, ingredientsm livestock and seafood. Steve Murrells, group CEO, said: “At Hilton Foods, our Sustainable ProteinPlan is at the heart of our operations. A huge part of this is how we can reach net zero by 2048. It is an ambitious target but this transition plan - one of the first of its kind in this sector - will help us stay focused and drive forward change in our own business.\" \"The road to net zero – Big Food’s emissions pledges\" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.

As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the beverages, alcohol and tobacco industry, including Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) and its peers. These companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the rise of cannabis, craft beer, and vaping or the steady decline of soda and cigarettes. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players. The 14 beverages, alcohol and tobacco stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2.7% below. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 3.6% on average since the latest earnings results. Born out of a complicated web of mergers and acquisitions, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) boasts a powerhouse beer portfolio of Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona, and local favorites around the world. Anheuser-Busch reported revenues of $15.05 billion, down 3.4% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 4.2%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ EBITDA estimates. “Beer is a passion point for consumers. Consumer demand for our megabrands and the execution of our mega platforms delivered another quarter of top- and bottom-line growth with margin expansion. Our teams and partners continue to execute our strategy and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our raised FY24 EBITDA growth outlook of 6-8%.” – Michel Doukeris, CEO, AB InBev Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 11% since reporting and currently trades at $55.96. Read our full report on Anheuser-Busch here, it’s free. With a primary focus on soda but also a presence in energy drinks and teas, Zevia (NYSE:ZVIA) is a better-for-you beverage company. Zevia PBC reported revenues of $36.37 million, down 15.6% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 6.8%. However, the business still had a strong quarter with optimistic EBITDA guidance for the next quarter and an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 85.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $2.01. Is now the time to buy Zevia PBC?

With its proprietary MetaPlus formula as the basis for key products, Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) offers energy drinks that feature natural ingredients to help in fitness and weight management. Celsius reported revenues of $265.7 million, down 30.9% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a softer quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ operating margin estimates. Celsius delivered the slowest revenue growth in the group. As expected, the stock is down 14.1% since the results and currently trades at $27.27. Read our full analysis of Celsius’s results here. Founded in 2004 followed by a 2021 IPO, The Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) offers coconut water products that are a natural way to quench thirst. Vita Coco reported revenues of $132.9 million, down 3.7% year on year. This print lagged analysts' expectations by 4.3%. In spite of that, it was a strong quarter as it recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and a solid beat of analysts’ gross margin estimates. Vita Coco achieved the highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The stock is up 13.7% since reporting and currently trades at $35.01. Read our full, actionable report on Vita Coco here, it’s free. With a history that goes back more than a century, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a household name in food and beverages today and best known for its flagship soda. PepsiCo reported revenues of $23.32 billion, flat year on year. This result lagged analysts' expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a slower quarter as it also produced a miss of analysts’ organic revenue growth and EBITDA estimates. The stock is down 1.9% since reporting and currently trades at $164. Read our full, actionable report on PepsiCo here, it’s free. As expected, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 25bps (a quarter of a percent) in November 2024 after Donald Trump triumphed in the US Presidential election. This marks the central bank's second easing of monetary policy after a large 50bps rate cut two months earlier. Going forward, the markets will debate whether these rate cuts (and more potential ones in 2025) are perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Adding to the degree of difficulty is a new Republican administration that could make large changes to corporate taxes and prior efforts such as the Inflation Reduction Act.

                "title": "Why Were Dividend King Stocks Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Procter & Gamble Falling After the Election?",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The broader indexes rallied after the election results, closing the week at all-time highs. But plenty of industry leaders were noticeably absent from the post-election run-up. Here's why Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) are sitting on the sidelines but are three dividend stocks that could still be worth buying now. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » The consumer staples sector is having a great year, buoyed by top names like Walmart and Costco Wholesale, which have both crushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite year to date. Coke and P&G also hit all-time highs earlier this year, but began cooling in late September. As you can see in the following chart, Coke, Pepsi, and P&G are down over the last three months, while the S&P 500 has soared 12.7%. So even before the election results came in, all three companies were pulling back from their highs. The simplest reason: earnings weren't great. Despite being on track for record profits in 2024, Coke's unit case volumes declined in the recent quarter. Coke had been keeping case volume growth barely positive. Coke has relied heavily on price increases to drive higher earnings. Declining case volumes are a red flag that consumers are resisting price increases and that Coke needs to take action to drum up demand. Similarly, Pepsi's latest quarter showed volume declines across all its major categories, including the drinks business and Pepsi-owned Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats. Pepsi has been a worse performer than Coke and P&G year to date, namely because it has been facing volume declines longer. However, Pepsi's management is getting creative with new ways to spark demand, such as giving customers more product per bag and increasing the number of small chip bags in variety packs. P&G's latest quarter also showcased weak sales growth. But P&G's pricing power is simply on another level, as the company is on track for another record year of profits and expects to grow net sales by low single digits. What's more, P&G generates plenty of extra earnings to aggressively repurchase stock at a much higher rate than Coke and Pepsi are capable of at this time. So unsurprisingly, P&G sports the most expensive valuation of the three companies, while Pepsi has the lowest. Still, disappointing quarters from all three companies don't explain why they missed out on the post-election rally. The biggest winners after the election results were sectors like financials and industrials, which could benefit from some of the new administration's policies such as less regulation, easier requirements for mergers and acquisitions, and potential subsidies for developing U.S. manufacturing and industrial production. Other sectors that rallied were the usual suspects of technology, consumer discretionary, and communications -- driven by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. The consumer staples sector tends to do well during times of uncertainty, which there was a lot of leading up to the election. But with the results in, investors seem to be gravitating toward cyclical sectors that could be coiled springs for economic growth. Long-term investors would do well to avoid getting caught up in short-term market movements or pile into and out of sectors just because they have momentum. Coke, Pepsi, and P&G stand out as three ultra-safe dividend stocks ideal for risk-averse investors. The companies Dividend Kings -- meaning they have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. Pepsi's streak is 52 years, Coke's is 62 years, and P&G is one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings with a 68-year streak. Investors should target these companies to generate passive income or supplement income in retirement, not to try and beat the market over a matter of months. All three companies sport reasonable valuations and price-to-earnings ratios that are less expensive than the S&P 500. It wouldn't be surprising if Coke, Pepsi, and P&G continue to underperform the broader market in the near term. If that happens, these companies could go from balanced buys to screaming buys that are too cheap to ignore.

Tariffs won't be the Grinch that stole Abercrombie & Fitch's (ANF) profits. At least not yet. Abercrombie & Fitch delivered another big earnings beat on Tuesday as its namesake division continued to resonate with young adults. The upside surprise came from the value-focused Hollister division — a business that is only now turning the corner amid new product introductions such as college-themed apparel. “Hollister is back,” Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz told Yahoo Finance. Abercrombie & Fitch stock fell about 5% on Tuesday as sales results at the Abercrombie division only matched elevated analyst estimates. Still, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez called the quarter \"strong\" in a note to clients. The Street may also have been concerned that the company's inventory growth outpaced sales growth going into a holiday shopping season where consumers continue to spend cautiously. Horowitz said the holiday season has started \"strong.\" Fresh potential tariffs on China that President-elect Trump floated late Monday also appeared to be weighing on investor sentiment. Abercrombie operates stores in China and sources apparel from the country. Trump proposed an additional 10% tariff on all products from China, contending the country was shipping illegal drugs to the US. CEOs such as Brooks Running' Dan Sheridan said tariffs could hammer the apparel industry on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Former longtime Gap and J Crew CEO Mickey Drexler echoed that sentiment on Opening Bid as well. Price increases could hurt consumer demand. Consumers would pay $13.9 billion to $24 billion more for apparel in the worst-case scenario for tariffs, the National Retail Federation estimated. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? \"When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,\" Horowitz said. \"It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this.\" Net sales: +14% year over year to $1.2 billion, vs. estimates for $1.2 billion Comparable sales: +16% vs. +11% estimate Abercrombie & Fitch division sales: $629.8 million, +15% year on year, vs. $629.5 million estimate Hollister division sales: $579.1 million, +14% year on year, vs. $552.6 million estimate Gross profit margin: 65.1% compared to 64.9% a year ago, vs. estimates for 65% Adjusted diluted EPS: +32% year over year to $2.50, vs. $2.37 estimate Sales have increased by a double-digit percentage for six straight quarters. Inventories only rose by 16% year over year, faster than sales growth. The company repurchased $100 million in stock in the quarter. Analyst note: The buybacks \"underscore our view that Abercrombie & Fitch has opportunity to buyback ~30% of the float in the next 3-4 years,\" Lejuez wrote in a note. Earnings call note: Execs confirmed they will \"prioritize\" buybacks in the fourth quarter.

                "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NIKE's estimated fair value is US$67.63 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$79.26 suggests NIKE is potentially trading close to its fair value Our fair value estimate is 26% lower than NIKE's analyst price target of US$91.24 Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for NIKE We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.60b US$4.49b US$5.03b US$4.75b US$5.27b US$5.47b US$5.66b US$5.84b US$6.01b US$6.19b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x8 Analyst x6 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 3.75% Est @ 3.41% Est @ 3.18% Est @ 3.01% Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$3.4k US$3.9k US$4.1k US$3.6k US$3.7k US$3.6k US$3.4k US$3.3k US$3.2k US$3.0k (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.6%) = US$134b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$134b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$66b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$101b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$79.3, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.154. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Luxury industry. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market. Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

                "title": "5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years. The share price of Constellation, America’s largest owner of nuclear plants, has more than doubled this year. Wall Street expects the company to post yearly earnings growth of 30% for 2024, while Visible Alpha predicts free cash flows could reach $1.5 billion. Building new plants is a regulatory nightmare, notes CFRA Research’s Daniel Reuven Rich, which gives existing operators an advantage. “They’re the only game in town,” he says, and it’s become a lucrative one. A thousand miles south, and 250 miles off the coast of New Orleans, the oil and gas company TechnipFMC (FTI) is building an elaborate network of manifolds and umbilical cords for between $250 million and $500 million to help oil giant BP extract 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Last quarter alone, the U.K.-incorporated company doing business from Houston secured $2.5 billion in subsea orders, adding to a backlog of $14.7 billion. Shareholders received $394 million in dividends and share buybacks in the first nine months of 2024 alone. But ATB Capital Markets analyst Waqar Syed says that’s only the beginning. Even as the company is projected to pull in around $9 billion in annual revenue, Syed says the backlog means not all the cash has been counted. “Orders are coming in at a much higher rate than the revenues are,” he says. “At some point their revenue is going to catch up.” Syed predicts FTI’s future cash flows will increase 76% in 2025 to $859.2 million, and the company has committed to return at least 60% of its future cash flow to shareholders. Looking abroad, it may be a good time to consider Spanish energy giant Iberdrola (IBDRY). Through its public U.S. subsidiary, Avangrid, it has doubled down on its renewable investments in the U.S., particularly with offshore wind. The company has pumped a combined $13.28 billion into projects in America and the U.K. over the past year, helping drive a 50% boost in net income through the first nine months of 2024. —Michael del Castillo and Greg Mckenna Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the explosive demand for artificial intelligence has driven a broader stock market boom. Public companies directly tied to the field have seen their market caps skyrocket, while industries even tangentially related to AI—such as the once-unloved utility sector—have enjoyed a bump. Given all the hype, skeptical investors may fear the sector has crossed the line from boom to bubble, but many analysts say AI stocks still have room to run. Starting with pure plays, it’s hard to bet against the company at the heart of the AI boom: Nvidia (NVDA). There is a ravenous appetite for its flagship GPU chips from a wide variety of companies scrambling to keep pace in the AI era. One analyst closely following the company, CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, said that Nvidia’s total addressable market is only set to expand. Its sales totaled $30 billion last quarter, up 122% from a year ago, and Zino expects the figure to surge upwards of $50 billion in two years’ time. He expects quarterly free cash flow to soon exceed that of every firm but Apple. It also stands to reason that Nvidia’s most deep-pocketed customers are the best positioned to make the necessary capital expenditures. “The big are only going to get bigger,” says Baird’s Ted Mortonson. “The monopolies are going to get more monopolistic.” Even among the giants of Big Tech, Microsoft (MSFT) is the leading high roller, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting the company’s capital outlay could hit $53 billion this year. That capex is already generating sales, according to CEO Satya Nadella, who says Microsoft's AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion alone in OpenAI since 2019—the main reason Mortonson believes the Seattle-based cloud titan is the best pick among the traditional tech outfits. Shares recently had their worst day in two years after the company forecast cloud growth to slow next quarter, presenting a potential opportunity to “buy the dip.” That may also be the case in application software, a sector yet to realize the benefits of AI. Salesforce (CRM) has been far from a Wall Street darling recently, with the stock trailing the S&P 500 and posting revenue growth in the single digits. Zino, however, believes the company is well positioned to deliver on so-called agentic AI—think autonomous digital assistants that put generative AI into action. “We think by the end of 2025 there are going to be a lot of investors that really kind of warm up to the Salesforce story,” Zino said. Not everyone agrees. Mortonson, for example, prefers cloud computing platform ServiceNow, which benefits from a close partnership with Nvidia. For those who believe in Salesforce’s long-term AI prospects, however, buying now could prove a bargain. —Leo Schwartz and G.M. According to a report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, the number of people getting active has increased every year for a decade. The report adds that threefourths of the U.S. population, or 242 million people, participated in at least one sports or fitness activity in 2023, a 2.2% bump from 2022. For investors looking to capitalize on this trend, the sporting-goods sector is a solid bet. According to David Swartz, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, the field includes names like Adidas, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Puma. But he says one company stands out above the others. “Nike (NKE) has a closer relationship with global and American sports than any other company,” Swartz tells Fortune. Nike’s stock has been pummeled this year over strategic missteps, including a failure to develop new products and a disastrous decision to favor direct-to-consumer distribution. But Morningstar believes it is now undervalued compared with its long-term fair value estimate of $117 per share. Morningstar forecasts compound average sales growth of 5% over the next 10 years, and expects Nike will achieve compound annual revenue growth of 2% in North America. Nike’s stock hit an all-time high of $177.51 in November 2021, but has since dropped by almost 50%. Swartz believes the company is poised for a comeback now that longtime Nike exec Elliott Hill is at the helm—he returned in October—and that Nike “will benefit from the growth of sports, both in the U.S. and globally.” Alongside the trend in increased physical activity is a new focus on self-care. This includes technology that identifies health risks for women, including breast cancer detection. A leading player in the field is Hologic (HOLX), a health care company with around $4 billion in annual revenue that provides 3D mammography technology. It has an 80%-plus share of the U.S. mammography imaging market and 30% internationally, according to Andrew Brackmann, a William Blair equity research analyst. Hologic, which has about 7,000 employees, also offers a range of tests for sexually transmitted infections as well as COVID-19. Since 2021, Hologic has scooped up seven companies and grown earnings at a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, Brackmann tells Fortune. Hologic’s stock is up about 16% this year. The growing field of prenatal diagnosis also offers an opportunity for investors, especially as preterm births in the U.S. have jumped by more than 10% in the past decade. In this field, Brackmann recommends a small firm called Sera Prognostics (SERA), which has created a blood test, called PreTRM, that helps identify which women may deliver prematurely. “There is a massive market need,” he says. Sera, which employs around 63 people, went public in 2021 but has never traded at or near its $16 IPO price. In August, Sera said it plans to publish the results of its PRIME study for the PreTRM test in the spring of 2025. Sera hasn’t gotten much traction with doctors, who have asked for more data, Brackmann says. “When the publication comes out it will generate a lot of buzz,” he notes. He expects Sera, which currently has negligible revenue, to bring in more than $100 million over the next three to five years. —Sheryl Estrada and Luisa Beltran At a time when the country was reeling from soaring prices, Fortune set about to pick 13 “inflation-proof” stocks. How did we do? In the 12 months since we published in November 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a 34% total return. Our portfolio: 51%. That’s not to say all our picks were winners. Two were blockbusters: chip darling Nvidia (total return, 193%) and big data company Palantir (179%). Other outperformers included e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and hefty dividend payers Kinder Morgan (pipelines) and Boston Properties (real estate). The other eight trailed the S&P, though none delivered negative returns. (Procter & Gamble, the worst performer, still gained 6%.) But overall, the home runs far outweighed the strikeouts. —Matt Heimer This article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 edition of Fortune with the headline \"5 trends for 2025 and how to invest in them.\" This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Sign in to access your portfolio",

More from Footwear News Is Nike Ready for a Major Comeback in Running? Stash's Legendary Nike Air Force 1 and Air Max 95 Are Officially Returning in December Industry Moves: Hari Mari Hires Kate White as Its First Chief Merchandising Officer + More  Nike has named a new HR chief. The Swoosh on Monday announced that it has promoted Treasure Heinle, currently chief talent officer, to the role of executive vice president and chief human resources officer, effective Jan. 6 2025. Heinle replaces Monique Matheson, who is retiring from the company after a 26-year tenure. The news represents the latest in a string of executive promotions and shifts at the Swoosh since Elliott Hill assumed the role of chief executive officer last month. It’s also the latest shift to occur in Nike’s HR business unit after the Swoosh named Kizmet Mills as its new DEI chief in late October. In her new role, Heinle will report to Hill and will oversee the company’s HR functions and general people strategy. “Treasure is a well-rounded leader who, during her extensive career, has successfully worked across all aspects of the HR function,” Hill said in a statement. “She has a strong record of bringing the best to Nike, driving a winning culture and building inclusive, world-class teams that deliver on the company’s growth strategy.” Heinle joined Nike in 2012 as vice president, HR business partner for North America and was named chief talent officer in 2022. Before joining Nike, Heinle worked in HR leadership at companies like Danaher, Tektronix and In-Focus. In early October, Nike offered mixed results in its first earnings call since announcing that its CEO John Donahoe would step down and be replaced by Hill. Given the CEO shift, Nike withdrew its guidance for the year and said it would provide quarterly guidance throughout 2025.

Merck's stock rose 2% Monday on the back of positive data from a study of a new hypertension drug. MRK stock has declined 7% so far this year, compared to a 5.7% increase for the wider pharmaceutical industry. Register now to see our 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days report - free today! Merck’s MRK phase III study called ZENITH evaluating its pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) drug, Winrevair (sotatercept), for more advanced disease, met its primary endpoint. The ZENITH study evaluated Winrevair, a novel activin signaling inhibitor, in patients with PAH, WHO Group 1 functional class (FC) III or IV at high risk of mortality. The study’s primary endpoint was time to first morbidity or mortality event, which could be either all-cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH hospitalizations. Top-line data from the study showed that treatment with Winrevair added to background PAH therapy, leading to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of morbidity or mortality events compared to placebo. Based on the overwhelming efficacy seen in the study, an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) recommended the study be stopped early. The DMC also recommended that patients with this advanced form of PAH be offered the opportunity to get Winrevair through an open-label extension study. Merck’s stock rose 2% on Monday as the positive data can potentially help expand the drug’s patient population. So far this year, Merck’s stock has declined 7% against an increase of 5.7% for the industry. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Winrevair was approved to treat PAH WHO Group 1 in the United States in March based on data from the STELLAR study. It was approved for similar use in the EU in August 2024. PAH is a rare, progressive blood vessel disorder that affects the blood vessel walls in the lungs, resulting in elevated blood pressure. It exerts significant strain on the heart, as it works harder to pump blood through the lungs, eventually leading to heart failure if left untreated. Winrevair is designed to target cellular signaling associated with vascular hyperproliferation and pathological remodeling to treat PAH. Winrevair works by blocking the proteins that contribute to the thickening of blood vessel walls in the lung. Merck is also evaluating Winrevair in another phase III study called HYPERION in newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk PAH patients. Winrevair is already seeing a strong launch, generating sales of $219 million this year. On the third-quarter conference call in October, the company said that the U.S. launch of the drug is gaining momentum, and the company is steadily adding new patients. More than 2,600 new commercial patients have started treatment since launch. In EU, Merck has launched Winrevair in Germany. It expects to obtain reimbursement for Winrevair in most other European markets, which typically takes 12 months, by the second half of 2025. Merck believes that Winrevair has the potential to generate significant revenues over the long term. Merck is pinning hopes on Winrevair to boost its top line once its blockbuster drug, Keytruda loses patent exclusivity in 2028. Merck added Winrevair following its $11 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Significant players in the PAH market are United Therapeutics UTHR and Johnson & Johnson JNJ. United Therapeutics markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States — Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca. Remodulin is an injectable formulation of treprostinil. Orenitram is an oral version of treprostinil, while Tyvaso is an inhaled version of Treprostinil. Remodulin, Orenitram and Tyvaso recorded sales of $403.6 million, $326.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, in the first half of 2024. As far as J&J is concerned, the PAH franchise was added to its portfolio with the 2017 acquisition of Actelion. J&J’s key PAH drugs are Opsumit and Uptravi. J&J recorded revenues of $3.19 billion from its PAH franchise in the first nine months of 2024, up 14% year over year. Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.

Trending: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. Earn a 1% return boost on your first EquityMultiple investment when you sign up here (accredited investors only). Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When estimating, you need two key variables – the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (3.20%). So, $1,200 / 0.032 = $37,500 to generate an income of $100 per month. You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. The dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis. For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40). In summary, income-focused investors may find Johnson & Johnson stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 242 shares of stock. There may be more upside as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes. Johnson & Johnson has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 62 years.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. During five years of share price growth, Johnson & Johnson achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.9% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 3% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). We know that Johnson & Johnson has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained. It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Johnson & Johnson the TSR over the last 5 years was 30%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! Johnson & Johnson provided a TSR of 6.2% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 5% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Healthcare Dive newsletter. Sanofi is joining its fellow drugmakers in trying to put new restrictions on savings sent to hospitals in a federal drug discount program. A spokesperson for Sanofi confirmed plans to implement a similar model as those proposed by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly — to give hospitals rebates for eligible drugs in program, called 340B, instead of discounts at the point of purchase — that have faced pushback from federal regulators. Sanofi plans to phase in its model for different 340B-eligible providers starting early next year. The rebates would apply to 25 drugs, including Dupixent, an injectable used to treat inflammatory diseases like eczema and asthma that’s currently one of the top 10 biggest drugs in global sales; Kevzara, which treats rheumatoid arthritis; and Lantus, a long-lasting insulin product. The fight over 340B is heating up as Sanofi becomes the latest drugmaker to try rolling out a rebate model for select medications in the drug discount program. With the model, Sanofi is following in the footsteps of J&J and Lilly, both of which sued the federal government this month after the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees 340B, moved to block their own rebate plans. The so-called Sanofi 340B Credit Model would require covered entities to disclose data to Sanofi backing up a medication’s eligibility for 340B discounts. Once verified, those facilities would then receive a credit from Sanofi for the difference between the lower 340B price and the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug. Covered entities should receive that payment from Sanofi before they have to pay the wholesaler for the drug, which should prevent providers from having to float the higher cost of a medication, according to the drugmaker. Sanofi plans to roll out the model to most hospitals, including critical access and disproportionate share hospitals, on Jan. 6. Health centers will be folded in on March 1. The model will not apply to other entities like children’s hospitals or Ryan White clinics, which provide HIV care. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said that, while the drugmaker supports 340B’s “core objective of increasing access to outpatient medicines,” it has been concerned with “growing evidence of fraud and abuse within the program” in the past few years. “The changes we are making are consistent with the 340B Program’s mission and statute by helping to eliminate prohibited duplicated discounts and diversion of 340B drugs away from eligible patients,” the spokesperson said. However, hospitals accuse drugmakers of trying to protect their profits through tightening how discounts are paid. That’s as the 340B program, created in 1992 to make it easier for providers serving large numbers of low-income and vulnerable patients to afford pricey medications, requires drugmakers to divvy out steep discounts on drugs that can be upwards of 50% off their price. The 25 drugs included in Sanofi’s credit model include some of its top-sellers, like Dupixent, which has brought in $9.6 billion in global sales year to date, and Lantus, which has made almost $1.2 billion. Regulators have also taken issue with drugmaker plans to apply rebates to 340B. J&J paused implementation of its own rebate model this fall after HRSA threatened sanctions and possible loss of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Sanofi has informed HRSA of its plans to roll out the model, and that regulators have not “substantially objected,” according to the Sanofi spokesperson. However, a spokesperson for HRSA reiterated that the agency considers implementing rebate models without express permission from the Secretary of the HHS unlawful. “HRSA has recently received inquiries from manufacturers related to different proposed rebate models for the 340B Program. HRSA continues to be in the process of reviewing these varied inquiries, which would significantly and unilaterally alter the administration of the Program,” HRSA spokesperson David Bowman said over email. Yet some lawmakers have amplified drugmaker concerns about hospitals gaming 340B, especially as the program has grown. 340B has ballooned to include more than one-third of U.S. hospitals, while prescription drugs purchased in 340B reached $66.3 billion in 2023, up more than 23% from 2022, according to government data. And research is mixed on hospitals’ use of 340B funds, with some studies finding hospitals use revenue from the program to expand healthcare services and subsidize uncompensated care. Others have used it for purposes unrelated to patient care, like acquiring physician practices. Similarly, audits of covered entities have found many providers aren’t complying with 340B requirements like not reselling discounted drugs. Congress is currently mulling over potential reforms to 340B, including requiring hospitals to be more transparent about what they do with program savings. Sanofi’s rebate proposal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Recommended Reading Eli Lilly follows J&J in suing Biden administration over 340B rebates Sign in to access your portfolio",

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend aristocrat stocks. Investors usually buy stocks with the expectation that their value will increase as the company grows more profitable. However, stocks can offer additional advantages. As businesses succeed and mature, they often choose to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as cash dividends. Even more appealing are companies that not only pay dividends but consistently increase them year after year. These stocks have delivered impressive performance over time compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Thornburg Investment Management, from 1990 to 2023, bond yields, represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, fell significantly from nearly 9% to 3.41%. Similarly, equity yields, reflected by the dividend payouts on the Dividend Aristocrats Index, declined from just over 3% to 2.42% during the same period. The Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks large-cap, blue-chip US companies within the broader market that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. The report further mentioned that dividend-paying stocks can not only offer a source of current income with the potential for growth over time but also help investors bring greater stability to their portfolios in the long run. The report cited Bloomberg’s data and highlighted that dividend aristocrats delivered an 11.63% return to shareholders between 1990 to 2023, compared with a 10.2% return for the broader market. Excluding the aristocrat factor from dividend stocks highlights their significance in overall market returns. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the broader market’s total returns, with the remaining 68% coming from capital appreciation. This demonstrates that both steady dividend income and the potential for capital growth play crucial roles in shaping total return expectations. The report also highlighted the significant impact of compounding when it comes to dividends. Without dividends, the market’s return from January 1, 1930, to the end of July 2023 would have grown to 214%. However, if dividends had been reinvested during the same period, the return would have reached an impressive 7,219%. Also read: 8 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now The dividend aristocrat index has delivered a 12.5% return since the start of 2024, underperforming the broader market that has returned nearly 27%. Although dividend stocks have lagged in performance this year, companies continue to increase their payouts, reflecting investor preferences steadily. According to a recent report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, 480 dividend increases were recorded in Q3 2024, compared to 448 in Q3 2023, representing a 7.1% year-over-year growth. The total value of these increases for the quarter reached $14.1 billion. Over the past 12 months, dividend increases amounted to $74.7 billion, up from $63.9 billion in the previous year.

Nobody can predict the future, but it's not hard to imagine increasing pharmaceutical sales. In 2022, prescription drug spending in the U.S. climbed more than 8% to reach $406 billion. It's a lot but still less than one-third of the amount soaked up by American hospitals. It might not feel like it when you pay the bill, but prescription drugs give healthcare systems a tremendous return on their investment. With this in mind, it's no wonder billionaires are buying up shares of one of America's largest pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » In the third quarter, Jeff Yass and the Susquehanna fund he manages raised its Pfizer stake to 10.3 million shares. Igor Tulchinsky more than doubled the size of WorldQuant Millennium Advisors' Pfizer stake by purchasing 1.2 million shares. Tulchinsky and Yass make lots of bets every quarter, and many of them don't work out. Before blindly following these billionaires, let's look at some of the reasons Pfizer's stock price has fallen about 49% since the end of 2022. Shares of Pfizer have been under pressure because the company is getting close to some patent cliffs. The main patent protecting Eliquis, a drug it markets in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, expires in 2026. Sales of the next-generation blood thinner are still on the rise and responsible for about 9% of total revenue. Pfizer has settled with several drug manufacturers that will hold off launching generic versions of Eliquis until April 1, 2028. In the meantime, it could lose exclusivity for Ibrance in the U.S. market in 2027. Ibrance sales are responsible for about 6% of total revenue, and a loss of exclusivity is only part of the problem. The blockbuster breast cancer treatment is already losing market share to similar drugs from Novartis and Eli Lilly, called Kisqali and Verzenio, respectively. Sales of these competitors bounded forward, but Q3 Ibrance sales fell 10% year over year. Pfizer's prostate cancer treatment, Xtandi, earned approval to treat early-stage prostate cancer patients in 2023. Q3 sales shot 28% higher to $561 million, but these gains could evaporate in a few short years. The main U.S. patent protecting Xtandi's exclusivity expires in 2027. Drug patents don't last very long compared to other forms of intellectual property. Big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer constantly funnel profits from their present blockbusters toward the next generation of products. For example, Pfizer acquired Biohaven and its migraine headache drug, Nurtec, for around $11.6 billion in 2022. Q3 sales rose 45% year over year to an annualized $1.3 billion because it's the only treatment approved to both prevent migraines and stop the headaches after they occur. According to Pfizer, 85% of physicians prescribing migraine headache treatments for the first time are choosing Nurtec. Padcev, a drug Pfizer acquired in 2023, is a part of the only chemo-free treatment for bladder cancer patients newly diagnosed with advanced-stage tumors. The combination of Padcev and Keytruda is now the most prescribed treatment for these patients. Q3 sales surged up to an annualized $1.6 billion and could reach $5 billion in a few years. Pfizer has raised its dividend payout for 15 consecutive years, but you don't need another raise to receive heaps of passive income from the stock. At recent prices, it offers a huge 6.4% yield. Investors can reasonably look forward to another dividend bump this December. Management expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $2.75 and $2.95 per share this year. That's more than enough to support raising a dividend payout set at an annualized $1.68 per share. Shares of Pfizer have been trading for the relatively low price of just 9.2 times adjusted-earnings expectations for 2024. At this low valuation, the stock can deliver market-beating gains even if earnings rise very slowly in the years ahead. Losing exclusivity for Eliquis, Ibrance, and Xtandi will sting, but these patent losses probably won't prevent Pfizer from growing earnings and its dividend payout over the long run. Following the lead of billionaires, in this case, could be a smart move. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

MRK stock has declined 7% so far this year, compared to a 5.7% increase for the wider pharmaceutical industry. Register now to see our 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days report - free today! Merck’s MRK phase III study called ZENITH evaluating its pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) drug, Winrevair (sotatercept), for more advanced disease, met its primary endpoint. The ZENITH study evaluated Winrevair, a novel activin signaling inhibitor, in patients with PAH, WHO Group 1 functional class (FC) III or IV at high risk of mortality. The study’s primary endpoint was time to first morbidity or mortality event, which could be either all-cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH hospitalizations. Top-line data from the study showed that treatment with Winrevair added to background PAH therapy, leading to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of morbidity or mortality events compared to placebo. Based on the overwhelming efficacy seen in the study, an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) recommended the study be stopped early. The DMC also recommended that patients with this advanced form of PAH be offered the opportunity to get Winrevair through an open-label extension study. Merck’s stock rose 2% on Monday as the positive data can potentially help expand the drug’s patient population. So far this year, Merck’s stock has declined 7% against an increase of 5.7% for the industry. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Winrevair was approved to treat PAH WHO Group 1 in the United States in March based on data from the STELLAR study. It was approved for similar use in the EU in August 2024. PAH is a rare, progressive blood vessel disorder that affects the blood vessel walls in the lungs, resulting in elevated blood pressure. It exerts significant strain on the heart, as it works harder to pump blood through the lungs, eventually leading to heart failure if left untreated. Winrevair is designed to target cellular signaling associated with vascular hyperproliferation and pathological remodeling to treat PAH. Winrevair works by blocking the proteins that contribute to the thickening of blood vessel walls in the lung. Merck is also evaluating Winrevair in another phase III study called HYPERION in newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk PAH patients. Winrevair is already seeing a strong launch, generating sales of $219 million this year. On the third-quarter conference call in October, the company said that the U.S. launch of the drug is gaining momentum, and the company is steadily adding new patients. More than 2,600 new commercial patients have started treatment since launch. In EU, Merck has launched Winrevair in Germany. It expects to obtain reimbursement for Winrevair in most other European markets, which typically takes 12 months, by the second half of 2025. Merck believes that Winrevair has the potential to generate significant revenues over the long term. Merck is pinning hopes on Winrevair to boost its top line once its blockbuster drug, Keytruda loses patent exclusivity in 2028. Merck added Winrevair following its $11 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Significant players in the PAH market are United Therapeutics UTHR and Johnson & Johnson JNJ. United Therapeutics markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States — Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca. Remodulin is an injectable formulation of treprostinil. Orenitram is an oral version of treprostinil, while Tyvaso is an inhaled version of Treprostinil. Remodulin, Orenitram and Tyvaso recorded sales of $403.6 million, $326.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, in the first half of 2024. As far as J&J is concerned, the PAH franchise was added to its portfolio with the 2017 acquisition of Actelion. J&J’s key PAH drugs are Opsumit and Uptravi. J&J recorded revenues of $3.19 billion from its PAH franchise in the first nine months of 2024, up 14% year over year. Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Roche RHHBY announced that it will acquire clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. PSTX for $9 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $1.0 billion. Shares of PSTX are up in pre-market trading on the acquisition news. Roche’s shares have lost 1.6% year to date against the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Per the terms, Roche will initiate a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Poseida common stock for $9.00 per share in cash. PSTX’s stockholders would also receive a non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) for up to an aggregate of $4.00 per share in cash, representing a total deal value of up to approximately $1.5 billion. The offer price of $9 represents a premium of approximately 215% to Poseida’s closing share price on Nov. 25, 2024. California-based Poseida’s R&D portfolio includes pre-clinical and clinical-stage off-the-shelf (also referred to as allogeneic) CAR-T therapies across several therapeutic areas, including hematological malignancies, solid tumors and autoimmune disease, as well as manufacturing capabilities and technology platforms. Poseida’s lead program, P-BCMA-ALLO1, is an allogeneic CAR-T therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). This candidate has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) after three or more prior lines of therapies, and FDA Orphan Drug Designation for MM. The pipeline also includes P-CD19CD20-ALLO1, an allogeneic dual CAR-T, being evaluated in a phase I study in B-cell malignancies. The acquisition will also add P-MUC1C-ALLO1, an allogeneic CAR-T program currently in phase I in solid tumors. The non-tradeable CVR will entitle its holders to receive the following contingent cash payments: $2.00 per share in cash, upon the initiation of the first study of a P-BCMA-ALLO1 product for the treatment of any indication (by Dec. 31, 2028), $1 per share in cash, upon the initiation of the study of a P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 product or of a P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 product for the treatment of an autoimmune indication (by Dec. 31, 2034) and $1 per share in cash upon the first commercial sale of a P-BCMA-ALLO1 product for the treatment of any indication (by Dec. 31, 2031). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. We note that Roche and Poseida had collaborated in 2022 to develop allogeneic CAR-T therapies directed to hematologic malignancies. Roche is currently looking to augment its pipeline after facing a few pipeline setbacks a couple of years ago. Earlier, Roche acquired privately owned Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion and forayed into the lucrative obesity market. The acquisition added a differentiated incretin portfolio with three candidates — CT-388, CT-996 and CT-868 — to its pipeline. Roche recently announced an asset purchase agreement with clinical-stage biotechnology company Regor Therapeutics. Per the agreement, Roche’s Genentech will acquire Regor’s portfolio of next-generation CDK inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer. Regor will receive an upfront cash payment of $850 million, along with additional milestone payments. Regor’s most advanced orally administered CDK4/2 inhibitor in the clinic, RGT-419B, will be added to Roche’s pipeline. Roche also announced that the late-stage SKYSCRAPER-01 did not achieve its primary endpoint of overall survival at the final analysis. SKYSCRAPER-01 is a global phase III, randomized, double-blind study evaluating tiragolumab plus Tecentriq compared to Tecentriq alone in 534 patients with PD-L1-high previously untreated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either tiragolumab plus Tecentriq or placebo plus Tecentriq until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. Nonetheless, the overall safety profile observed remained consistent with longer follow-up, and no new safety signals were identified. Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

                "content": "   Manage your account  President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House is expected to be largely negative for the electric vehicle industry, given his years of past opposition and personal distaste for the technology. His team has already started plotting out his anti-EV moves. Trump’s transition team is reportedly planning to get rid of the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases as part of a broader tax shakeup, which is likely to slam sales. The credits are part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Trump has said he wants to scrap, and are seen as a major driver of the EV transition. In just three months, EV buyers saved $600 million thanks to those credits, the Treasury Department said. “The tax incentive is important,” Aaron Viles, the senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, told Quartz earlier this year. With most early adopters — people most interested or invested in the tech — already owning an EV, automakers need to reach the consumers concerned about high vehicle costs. More than a dozen EVs are eligible for the full tax credit — and several more that are eligible for a smaller credit would become more expensive if Trump axes the credit. Here are the electric vehicles to buy while the tax credit is still active. Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y SUV, Model X crossover SUV, and Model 3 compact all qualify for the full tax credit, while the company’s Cybertruck pickup and Model S luxury car do not. According to the Energy Department, whether each specific model is eligible for the full tax credit depends on its model year. For example, the 2024 Model Y equipped with rear-wheel drive is eligible, as is the 2023-2025 Model Y Performance. The only version of the Model X eligible for the tax credit is the 2023-2025 model year equipped with an all-wheel drive. As for the Model 3, the Energy Department notes that the eligibility of the 2025 Model 3 Long Range equipped with all-wheel drive may vary. On the whole, Tesla is among the automakers expected to be least affected by a plan to axe the Inflation Reducation Act, given its dominance in the market. CEO Elon Musk has said that in the long term, it “probably actually helps Tesla,” and he wants all tax credits for both electric vehicles and gas-powered cars to be removed. A handful of Chevrolet (GM) cars qualify for the full tax credit, including the Blazer SUV. Both the 2024 and 2025 model year Blazers qualify for the credit, according to the Department of Energy. The Blazer was the first Chevy vehicle made on General Motors’ Ultium platform, which has since been renamed and came out with a rocky launch. However, reviews for the Blazer have become much more positive over the last several months. Chevy’s 2022 and 2023 Bolt EV and Bolt EUV also qualify, although GM discontinued those vehicles at the end of last year. However, the Bolt is set for a comeback in 2025. The second-generation Chevy Bolt will be the company’s most affordable model and lead a new family of vehicles when it launches in late 2025, GM President Mark Reuss said last month, according to Automotive News. The Cadillac Lyriq has emerged as a dominating force in the luxury EV market. From January through September, more than 20,000 units were sold in the U.S., establishing it as the best-selling mid-size electric SUV so far in 2024. The $7,500 tax credit applies to purchases of both the 2024 and 2025 Lyriq, which has helped consumers interested in buying the unit, which starts at $58,590. In October, General Motors said the Lyriq would become the first EV in its portfolio to earn the V-Series performance badge. The 2026 Lyriq-V SUV will launch early next year in the U.S. and a handful of other markets, according to the company. The Acura ZDX SUV is the only electric vehicle offered by the luxury division of Honda (HMC) Motor — and the result of a collaboration with General Motors. The 2024 ZDX is made alongside the Cadillac Lyriq in Spring Hill, Tennessee, sharing the same platform, batteries, and electric motors, although their designs are drastically different. Each of the ZDX’s trims is eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, as even the priciest — the ZDX Type S with performance tiers and wheels costs $74,500. German car giant Volkswagen (VWAGY) has just one model that qualifies for the tax credit, the ID.4 SUV, which comes in a variety of trims that are eligible. The Department of Energy lists both the 2023 and 2024 model year ID.4 as eligible, which are produced at Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Both the ID.4 and the ID.3 are set to get a major overhaul in 2026, including a return to the more traditional two-box silhouette and other simple design features, according to Auto Express. Ford Motor Co.’s (F) award-winning electric truck has been one of the best-known electric vehicles to come out of the U.S. in recent years. Sales of the F-150 Lightning more than doubled last quarter to 7,162 units sold. The full tax credit applies to the 2022-2025 F-150 Lightning with both standard-range and extended-range batteries, which has helped boost sales. Ford has also offered a series of incentives to boost sales and slashed prices. The Detroit automaker is also offering a deal that lets customers lease a 2024 F-150 Lightning that includes $3,500 in Electric Vehicle Red Carpet Lease Cash and $3,000 in Bonus Cash, according to CarBuzz. The 2024-2025 Equinox electric SUV is the last Chevrolet vehicle that can qualify for the $7,500 tax credit. The Equinox debuted in May as one of the more affordable EVs currently available. Last quarter — the first full sales quarter since Equinox deliveries began — more than 15,000 units were sold. In October, General Motors confirmed that the lower-priced Chevy Equinox EV LT is available for order. With the tax credit, prices could be brought down to as low as $27,495, Electrek reported. Chrysler’s (STLA) Pacifica plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is the only hybrid currently eligible for the entire $7,500 tax credit, according to the Energy Department. That gives the model a bit of an edge over its fully-electric rivals for consumers hesitant to entirely ditch the reliability of a gas-powered vehicle, as well as a pricing advantage over its fellow hybrids sold by the likes of Toyota Motor. The tax credit applies to the 2022 through 2024 Pacifica PHEV minivans. Honda’s 2024 Prologue SUV was the fifth-best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. last quarter, outsold by only Ford’s Mustang Mach-E and a handful of Tesla models. That’s a solid performance for a vehicle launched in March, especially since it’s Honda’s first all-electric SUV. Several automakers are making moves to increase their vehicles’ eligibility for the tax credit. Hyundai Motor Co. (HYMTF) is one of them. The South Korean automaker plans to build a total of six models across its namesake brand, as well as Kia and Genesis, that will qualify for the tax credit through U.S. assembly and battery sourcing operations. It’s building factories in both Ellabell, Georgia, and Bartow County. On Thursday, Hyundai revealed the 2026 Ioniq 9, the first new model set to be made in Ellabell. The three-row electric SUV is expected to qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, according to the company. While those EVs and PHEVs qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, several other models are eligible for a partial credit of about $3.750. That includes Rivian’s (RIVN) R1T electric pickup and R1S electric SUV, as well as Nissan’s (NSANY) Leaf electric compact car. On the hybrid side, Jeep’s Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe, Ford’s Escape, Lincoln’s Corsair Grand Touring, and Audi Q5 vehicles across their respective applying model years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Monday it will not reconsider a landmark rule finalized in April requiring nearly all new cars and trucks by 2029 to have advanced automatic emergency braking systems.

                "title": "Buy GM Stock After a Dip from 52-Week Highs Amid Trump Tariff Concerns?",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President-Elect Donald Trump’s decision to appoint billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the next secretary of the Department of Treasury was well received by markets yesterday with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones reaching new highs. However, auto stocks have sold off sharply on Tuesday amid Trump’s plan to implement a 25% tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico. This would dissolve the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada) free trade agreement with auto giant General Motors GM expected to feel the brunt of the impact. With operations throughout North America, GM shares have fallen -8% in today's trading session. Optimistically, investors may be wondering if the selloff could be a buying opportunity as GM hit a 52-week high of $61 a share to start the week and is still sitting on +50% gains year to date. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Leading to the recent peak in GM has been the company’s strong financial performance with total sales now expected to increase 5% in fiscal 2024 to what would be an annual record of $180.02 billion based on Zacks estimates. Despite GM’s top line projected to dip -2% next year, the company would remain the largest U.S. automaker in terms of revenue ahead of Ford F and Tesla TSLA which are expected to bring in $174.28 billion and $99.65 billion in FY24 respectively. More impressive, GM is on pace to set an annual record for profitability as well with earnings forecasted to soar 34% in FY24 to $10.29 per share versus EPS of $7.68 last year. Furthermore, FY25 EPS is projected to expand another 2%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Most glaring in regards to General Motors stock being a buy-the-dip candidate is that GM trades at 5.8X forward earnings. Trading at a considerable discount to the S&P 500’s 25.3X forward earnings multiple and its Zacks Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 13.1X, GM also trades beneath Ford’s 6.2X with Tesla at a noticeable premium of 137.2X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As the largest domestic automaker in terms of revenue, GM trades at just 0.3X sales with its industry average at 1X and the S&P 500 at 5.4X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Most compelling to long-term investors has been GM’s expansion in the electric vehicle market. Led by its Chevy Equinox EV, GM’s EV sales most recently skyrocketed 192% during Q3 2024 to 32,095 units compared to 11,006 EVs sold in the prior-year quarter. As of now, GM has surpassed Ford in terms of total EV sales in the U.S. this year behind Tesla. Image Source: GM.com  On pace for a record year, it's hard to overlook General Motors stock as a buy-the-dip target with GM sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Still, it will be important to pay attention to the trend of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors’ FY25 as some analysts believe President Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico could affect the auto giant’s profit margins by 2% or more. That said, the tarriff proposal could be a bargaining ploy for Trump considering free trade agreements have been in place between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico since 1994.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Shares of US automakers tumbled on worries that a new round of tariffs imposed by President-elect Donald Trump will cause sticker prices to soar even further. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Trump said that he would impose additional 10% levies on goods from China and 25% on all products from Mexico and Canada – critical trade routes for the auto industry’s global supply chain. It’s unclear how new tariffs would be implemented under an existing trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, but the threat underscores the incoming president’s intention to shake up global trade ties. Tariffs of that magnitude on the roughly $97 billion worth of auto parts and 4 million finished vehicles that come to the US from Canada and Mexico would be “devastating,” Wolfe Research analysts said in a note on Tuesday. Average new-car prices would rise about $3,000, they said, adding to an almost $50,000 cost that many consumers are struggling to afford. “The entire year, we’ve been talking about affordability,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at market researcher Cox Automotive. “Anything that’s going to increase prices is going to be difficult for consumers who are already facing difficulties in affording vehicles.” General Motors Co.’s shares fell 9% on Tuesday, the biggest drop since 2020. Shares of Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV also declined. Stellantis, Volkswagen AG, Ford and GM would be “highly exposed” to an increase in tariffs on Canada and Mexico, according to Bernstein analysts. Stellantis and VW import about 40% of the vehicles they sell in the US, while GM imports roughly 30% and Ford 25%, according to a research note. GM and Stellantis import 55% of trucks sold in the US from Mexico and Canada, according to Bernstein. Stellantis imports the heavy-duty version of its Ram pickup trucks and commercial vans from Mexico. Ford imports the electric Mustang Mach-e from Mexico, as well as the Bronco Sport SUV and Maverick small pickup truck. Trump repeatedly vowed during his campaign to use tariffs to bring more factories and jobs back to the US. It’s an outgrowth of his first term in office, when he employed a combination of real and threatened tariffs in an effort to reorder industry supply chains and trade alliances. Even if Trump follows through with the tariff threat, it would not result in an immediate bump to auto jobs, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions. “It will take years to shift production from one place to another,” he said. “And it’s not going to add jobs in six months. In the short-term, it’s definitely gonna be a hardship.” Retaliation Risk The auto industry’s outsized role in US-Mexico trade was on full display Tuesday, as Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum invoked GM, Ford and Stellantis by name as she suggested the country could raise tariffs of its own in response to new levies by Trump. “One tariff will be followed by another in response, and so on until we put common companies at risk,” she said during her daily press conference in Mexico City. “The main exporters from Mexico to the US are General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford Motor Company, which arrived 80 years ago. Why put in place a tariff that puts them at risk?” GM has one of its four North American plants making large pickup trucks in Silao, Mexico, with much of its production coming to the US. The Detroit-based carmaker also imports the Chevrolet Equinox EV from a plant in Ramos Arizpe, which also builds the Blazer EV. The Equinox starts at $35,000 and played a big role in GM’s surge in plug-in sales in the second half of this year. Additional levies could also pose risk to a push by Jeep and Ram brand owner Stellantis to shift its manufacturing footprint to lower-cost countries, including Mexico. It’s part of an effort by Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares to drive down the cost of EVs and offset higher labor expenses in the US — a strategy squarely at odds with the agenda of Trump’s incoming administration. The automaker has laid off thousands of workers in Michigan and Ohio this year, including 1,100 at a truck plant in Warren, Michigan. At the same time, it’s expanding a truck plant in Saltillo, Mexico to make Ram 1500 pickups in addition to the heavy-duty trucks it already makes there. Contingency Plans Given the magnitude of auto industry fallout from additional tariffs, “we’d expect most investors to assume Trump ultimately does not follow through with these threats,” Wolfe analysts led by Emmanuel Rosner said in their note. “However, we can’t say for sure.” Chris Feuell, the CEO of the Ram brand, said last week that the company would be flexible in navigating any policy changes from the 47th president and could potentially revise its investment plans. At an industry conference in New York last week, Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company has been gaming out various scenarios to determine what impact tariffs might have on their business and how the company would adjust pricing and profitability. “We’ll have to see what the level of tariff is and what we can do with that,” Lawler told analysts at a Barclays conference on Nov. 20. “Remember it’s four years and we don’t know how lasting this will be. We need to think about things on the longer cycle and the longer arc.” --With assistance from Keith Naughton, Rafael Gayol and Carolina Millan. (Updates with analyst comment from third paragraph.)

Shares in Dell slid 11% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, after the computer and software manufacturer posted third quarter results that missed revenue estimates. Revenue came in at $24.37bn (£19.32bn), which was below consensus expectations of $24.59bn. However, Dell reported record third-quarter revenue from its infrastructure solutions group business, rising 34% to $11.4bn. Server and networking revenue was up 58% to $7.4bn, noting demand growth across AI and traditional servers. Dell's AI-optimised servers are powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) chips.

Dell executives said in a post-earnings conference call that its enterprise customers were being mindful on their PC and IT spending in the near-term, Reuters reported. In addition, they said that its consumer business was also softer than expected. Revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter of between $24bn and $25bn also appeared to disappoint against average estimates of $25.57bn, according to Reuters. Fellow computer maker HP also tumbled into the red in after hours trading, after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results in line with analyst estimates. HP posted net revenue of $14.1bn for the fourth quarter, up 1.7% year-on-year, giving it a total of $53.6bn for the year, which was flat versus 2023.

For the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, HP estimated GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.63. HP shares were down nearly 9% pre-market open on Wednesday. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was another company with shares falling in extended trading, after it posted weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. The stock was down nearly 6% after CrowdStrike guided to adjusted per share of $0.84 to $0.86 for the fourth quarter, which was below Bloomberg-compiled estimates of $0.87 per share.

Budget airline EasyJet posted a 34% increase in annual headline profit before tax to £610m ($769m), in results released on Wednesday. The low-cost carrier reported record profit before tax for its easyJet holidays business, up 56% year-on-year, to £190m. As a result, EasyJet said it was hiking its dividend to 12.1p per share for the year, which is more than double the 4.5p it paid out for the 2023 fiscal year. Looking ahead to its 2025 fiscal year, easyJet said capacity was expected to grow by 3% to around 103 million seats.

These have ranged over the years from the possibility of strike actions to conflicts and volcanic ash clouds, let alone the major shock which the pandemic brought.\" \"Indeed, the EasyJet share price remains some 52% shy of pre-pandemic levels, indicating how much damage can be done by exogenous events and how difficult the recovery path can be,\" he said. However, Hunter added: \"The general view towards the company is also undiminished, with the market consensus of the shares as a buy on optimism for the longer term still firmly intact.\" EasyJet shares were up nearly 2% on Wednesday morning, with the stock up 7.5% year-to-date. Online food delivery platform Just Eat announced on Wednesday morning that it planned to delist its shares from the London Stock Exchange, effective from the morning of 27 December 2024. Just Eat said it made the decision in order to \"reduce the administrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\". Following the delisting in London, the company said it would maintain its primary listing of its shares on the Euronext Amsterdam market.

This has been a busy month on the news front for Wall Street. Between Election Day, earnings season, and the October inflation report, investors haven't been hurting for catalysts. But among these various data releases, you might have missed what's arguably the most important of them all -- the Nov. 14 deadline to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the September-ended quarter. A 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. These filings offer investors a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's most-famous money managers have been buying and selling. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Although investors eagerly wait for the curtain to lift on Warren Buffett's trading activity at Berkshire Hathaway, he's far from the only billionaire who's overseen big-time returns on Wall Street. For instance, investors also tend to pay close attention to Ken Griffin at Citadel, who oversees the most-profitable hedge fund since inception. Citadel operates an active fund that almost always hedges its common-stock position with put and call options, and may have other positions (short positions, as well as options held short) that don't show up in a 13F filing. But among the countless trades made by Griffin's hedge fund during the third quarter, two stand out. Arguably one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the planet right now is cloud data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). Shares of Palantir have skyrocketed by 791% on a trailing-two-year basis, as of this writing on Nov. 23, with the company's market cap briefly tipping the scales at $150 billion last week. Yet in spite of these otherworldly gains, billionaire Ken Griffin disposed of 91% of the Palantir common shares Citadel's hedge fund held during the September-ended quarter. There were also corresponding increases in put and call options held by Citadel for Palantir, which hedges against its common-stock position. Before digging into the catalysts that might coerce a billionaire money manager and their team to sell shares of Palantir, it's important to first understand the bull thesis. The wind in Palantir's sails is its irreplaceability at scale. The company's AI-inspired Gotham platform is used by federal governments to plan and execute missions, as well as gather copious amounts of data. Meanwhile, its AI- and machine learning-powered Foundry platform helps businesses make sense of their data. No other company comes close to offering the breadth of services that Palantir can, which leads to highly predictable operating cash flow quarter after quarter. The other catalyst for Palantir Technologies is its push to recurring profitability. Businesses with sustainable moats that demonstrate their ability to generate a profit are often rewarded with a hearty valuation premium by investors. On the flipside, valuation might be the biggest reason Ken Griffin, along with other billionaire money managers, sent shares of Palantir packing in the third quarter. As of the closing bell on Nov. 22, shares of the company were valued at more than 42 times Wall Street's consensus sales forecast for 2025, as well as 137 times projected earnings per share (EPS). Both levels are consistent with bubble-like valuations that won't be sustainable over the long run. Additionally, since Gotham can only be used by the U.S. government and its allies, there's a somewhat limited long-term opportunity for Palantir's core profit-driving operating segment. Although Foundry is growing like a weed, it's not yet the proven operating platform that Gotham is. More than likely, Palantir's near-parabolic increase in its share price won't be sustainable. Perhaps even more surprising than Griffin overseeing the sale of most of his hedge fund's common-stock stake in Palantir Technologies was witnessing he and his team reverse course on Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during the September-ended quarter. After being a decisive seller of Nvidia stock during the second quarter, which is when Nvidia conducted its historic 10-for-1 stock split, Citadel's hedge fund increased its holdings in this AI colossus by 194% during the third quarter. Once again, this increase occurred as Citadel's put and call option positions in Nvidia were reduced, which demonstrates the ongoing hedges Griffin's fund has in place. The reason institutional investors and billionaire asset managers have piled into Nvidia is very simple: its unmistakable dominance in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) accounted for an estimated 98% of shipments to data centers in 2022 and 2023, per TechInsights, and orders for its H100 GPU (commonly known as the \"Hopper\" chip) and Blackwell GPU are currently backlogged. Nvidia's hardware is the preferred option as the brains that power split-second decision-making for high-compute data centers. To add to the above, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin are undeniably benefiting from enterprise demand swamping supply. When the demand for a good outpaces supply, the law of supply and demand states the price of that good will rise until demand tapers. Nvidia has been netting $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is double to quadruple the price point of Advanced Micro Devices Insight MI300X AI-GPU. It should also be noted that no other company appears to be particularly close to challenging the computing capabilities of Nvidia's GPUs. While competing chips may offer subtle advantages with select tasks, or perhaps be more energy efficient, they continue to play second fiddle to the computing potential of Nvidia's hardware. But there's another side to the Nvidia story that Griffin and other optimistic billionaire money managers may be overlooking. For example, competitive pressures are beginning to crop up, as evidenced by the sudden gross margin decline Nvidia is contending with. AI-GPU scarcity has played a critical role in boosting Nvidia's pricing power and its gross margin. However, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even though these chips aren't superior to Nvidia's hardware, they're cheaper and more easily accessible. When combined with AMD and other external rivals ramping production of their AI-GPUs, it's easy to see how Nvidia's pricing power and margins could wane in the coming quarters. Nvidia is also contending with history, which has been anything but an ally of game-changing innovations over the last three decades. For 30 years, investors have consistently overestimated the early stage utility and adoption of new technologies and innovations, which has eventually led to a bubble-bursting event. There's nothing that suggests AI or Nvidia is going to be the exception.

It took three years, but annual ETF inflows are back at record levels. On Tuesday, year-to-date inflows for U.S.-listed ETFs topped $902 billion—and then on Wednesday, they breached $909 billion. That means that, with a month-and-a-half left in the year, 2024 inflows are tracking to end up comfortably ahead of the previous annual record of $900 billion set in 2021.Of course, it’s still possible that ETFs could register outflows from now through December, putting inflows below $900 billion at the end of the year—but it seems very unlikely.Inflows have been robust all year long, and recent enthusiasm in the stock market following the U.S. presidential election suggests that December will be a strong month for inflows. In fact, if trends persist, an annual inflows record of more than $1 trillion seems to be in the cards, with an outside shot at $1.1 trillion.In addition to being a new record, such a haul would be a sharp acceleration compared to the roughly $600 billion of inflows seen in both 2022 and 2023. A buoyant stock market, a plethora of new product launches, and the rise of active ETFs have all contributed to the surge of interest in exchange-traded funds this year. Another inflows milestone that etf.com has been watching is the $100 billion mark for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).Earlier this year, the ETF broke the calendar-year inflows record for an individual ETF when it surpassed $47 billion in inflows. It’s since almost doubled that haul, bringing year-to-date inflows up to $93 billion, according to etf.com’s Fund Flows tool. The ETF has pulled in about $17 billion of new money over the past month, a pace that if maintained, means that VOO will easily crack $100 billion by year end.In other words, 2024 could be the first trillion-dollar year for ETFs as a whole and the first $100 billion year for a single ETF.

                "title": "2 firm inflation prints just made the Fed's 2025 rate cut path a lot 'murkier'",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. October inflation readings out this week have shown little progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target, putting into question how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2025. On Wednesday, the \"core\" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% for the third consecutive month during October. Then, on Thursday, the \"core\" Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed prices increased by 3.1% in October, up from 2.8% the month prior and above economist expectations for a 3% increase. Taken together, the readings are adding to an overall picture of persistent, sticky inflation within the economy. Economists don't see the data changing the Fed's outlook come December. And markets agree with the CME FedWatch Tool currently placing a nearly 80% chance the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting. But the lack of recent progress on the inflation front could prompt the Fed to adjust its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which had forecast the central bank would cut interest rates four times, or by one percentage point in total, throughout 2025. \"PPI won’t decisively alter the Fed’s easing bias, but it makes charting the policy outlook murkier,\" Nationwide financial market economist Oren Klachkin wrote in a note to clients today. \"We anticipate 75 [basis points] of cumulative Fed easing in 2025, but risks seem to be tilting toward a more gradual pace of easing.\" \"Their bias is toward cutting, but they'll probably have to have to go at a slower pace next year,\" Wolfe Research chief economist Stephanie Roth told Yahoo Finance (video above). Markets have quickly shifted over the past two months to reflect this sentiment. On Sept. 18, when the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point, markets had projected the Fed would finish 2025 with a federal funds rate around 3%. Now, the market is pricing in about 80 fewer basis points of easing next year. This speculation has also prompted a large increase in bond yields over the past month. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has added about 80 basis points since the Fed's first rate cut in September. But that in itself hasn't proven to be a headwind for the stock market rally, as all three indexes are within striking distance of new record highs. Investors have attributed the market's resilience to stronger-than-expected economic data flowing in as bond yields rise. \"The reason it hasn't hit the stock market is very simply because if the yield is rising, partly because growth is going to be stronger, that effect is going to be stronger on the stock market,\" Bridgewater Associates co-chief investment officer Karen Karniol-Tambour said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference. At his most recent press conference on Nov. 7, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation continues to come down on a \"bumpy path\" but declined to provide forward guidance on the Fed's path. \"We don't know the right pace, and we don't know exactly where the destination [of rates] is,\" Powell said. \"So the point is to find that, to find the right pace and the right destination as we go. And I think there's a fair amount of uncertainty about that. \" But economists are taking hints from recent trends within the inflation prints. The three-month annualized rate of core inflation moved from 3.1% last month to 3.6% after the October CPI release. This underscores the recent lack of progress toward the Fed's 2% goal. Add the potential inflationary economic policies expected from President-elect Donald Trump, and the picture becomes even more uncertain. \"The inflation data over the past few months have not shown much additional progress, and the election outcome has raised new questions about the path ahead for price growth,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note to clients. \"We think the time is fast approaching when the FOMC will signal that the pace of rate cuts will slow further, perhaps to an every-other-meeting pace starting in 2025.\" Economists use the data from CPI and PPI to project a reading from the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau believes that release, due out at the end of November, will show core prices rose 2.8% in October, up from 2.7% in September. \"If our forecast proves correct, it will mark two consecutive uncomfortably high prints as the Fed seeks to return inflation to its 2% target,\" Juneau wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. He added this doesn't mean markets should \"panic.\" Some of the factors driving inflation higher in October, like financial services and airfares, aren't expected to last. Additionally, inflation expectations remain low, and the labor market no longer appears to be a cause of concern on the inflation front. Still, Juneau, like other economists, argues the recent data shows \"the risk appears to be tilting toward a shallower cutting cycle given resilient [economic] activity and stubborn inflation.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Exchange-traded fund inflows are on the cusp of breaking their annual record after investors piled into ETFs following Trump’s election victory.Year-to-date inflows for U.S.-listed ETFs stood at $892 billion as of Monday, Nov. 11, just a tad short of the $900 billion mark reached in 2021. With over a month-and-a-half left in the year, the record is almost certain to fall—possibly as soon as this week. After that, attention will shift to the symbolic $1 trillion level, which suddenly looks achievable by year's end. Last December, inflows for U.S.-listed ETFs were well over $100 billion; this year, with investor sentiment surging in the wake of the election, it’s conceivable that Dec. 2024 inflows could be just as strong, or even stronger. Meanwhile, another milestone that could be reached by year's end is the $100 billion flows mark for an individual ETF.Since the start of the year, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has gathered $90 billion of new assets, the largest haul by far for a single ETF in a calendar year. Over the past month, inflows of VOO have totaled $13 billion, suggesting that the fund has a good shot to hit $100 billion of inflows by the end of 2024.VOO’s inflows are significantly higher than the $56 billion that’s been invested in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) since the start of the year. Speaking of records, while we tend to focus on the U.S. ETF industry here at etf.com, the ETF structure remains popular around the world. Data from BlackRock shows that worldwide ETF inflows hit an annual record at the end of October— $1.4 trillion versus the previous $1.33 trillion record from 2021. While the U.S. drove much of those inflows, strong demand for exchange-traded funds in Europe has also contributed.

The post-election stock market rally that has been dubbed the “Trump trade” has the potential to extend well into next year, according to some market watchers. Beyond the initial market pop driven by investors interpreting the election of Republican Donald Trump as bullish for markets, Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA, anticipates a more business-friendly environment under Trump. “This is generally bullish for ETFs,” Ullal said. “One of the factors driving the initial rally is the expectation of less regulations around financials and energy, but there are also expectations that the strength of the stock market could broaden into small- and mid-cap stocks.” Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital in New York City, also sees a Trump presidency as bullish for smaller U.S. companies. “This is definitely bullish for small caps, but it is really more about specific sectors than market capitalization,” he said. Hatfield noted that it is a common misconception that smaller companies in general are more leveraged and therefore more interest rate-sensitive. “Smaller companies are de facto interest rate sensitive because the sectors of the index tend to be lower in technology and higher in financials and real estate and other companies that do better when we’re not in Fed tightening cycle,” he said. “But right now, we’re in a Fed loosening cycle, and we’re more optimistic about rates than the market because we think most of Trump’s policies are disinflationary.” One of the shifts Hatfield expects under Trump is a Federal Trade Commission that will encourage consolidation. “The most important thing to think about is that small companies are acquisition targets, but the FTC has been putting a lid on consolidation,” Hatfield said. Then, there is the potential for a reduced corporate tax rate, down to 15% from the current 21%. “There will be a new tax bill, and a corporate tax reduction will be in that bill,” said Hatfield, who expects the S&P 500 Index to gain 25% next year. “And we think small caps will beat that 25%,” he added. Ullal said the initial rally of financial sector stocks following last week’s election was in response to a more relaxed regulatory environment, considering the Republican track record of being “less hawkish on antitrust action.” Another factor supporting small-cap stocks is the valuation levels of large-cap stocks, illustrated by the S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.3, compared to a historical average of 16. Small- and mid-cap stocks, meanwhile, have forward p/es of around 17, which is in line with their historical averages. “Large caps are already richly valued,” Ullal said. “That can continue for some time, but at some point, we may hit a ceiling.”  Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

At various points he took credit for equities rallies, urged Americans to buy the dip, and even considered firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who he blamed for a selloff.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The S&P 500's (^GSPC) surge to record highs since Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election is showing no signs of stopping. And Wall Street strategists have been quick to update their outlooks on where stocks may be headed next. On Monday, Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni wrote in a note to clients that he expects the S&P 500 to hit 6,100 by the end of 2024, about 2% above current levels. Yardeni then sees the index reaching 7,000 by the end of 2025, 8,000 by the end of 2026, and 10,000 by the end of the decade. Previously, Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he'd seen the S&P 500 hitting 8,000 by the end of the decade. \"We're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,\" Yardeni told Yahoo Finance. \"And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed. And in addition to that, a lot of deregulation.\" In his note, Yardeni wrote the market is showing early signs of \"animal spirits\" coming into play. Key to Yardeni's call is a boost to his earnings estimates and margin projections for the S&P 500 due to Trump's policies. The earnings estimates assume Trump will \"quickly lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%.\" Yardeni's decade-end forecast would mark a return of about 66% from current levels, or about 11% annually, roughly in line with the long-term average annual return of the S&P 500. There are concerns, like sticky inflation readings, which may prompt investors to question whether the Federal Reserve will stop cutting interest rates. And others, like the team at Goldman Sachs — which recently called for a 3% annual return for the S&P 500 over the next decade — have reasoned that, eventually, the bull market will turn into a bear. \"We aren't saying that a recession can't occur over the rest of the decade,\" Yardeni wrote in his note to clients. \"However, we note that despite the significant tightening of monetary policy during 2022 through 2024, there has been no recession. Why should there be one over the remainder of the Roaring 2020s?\" Research from FactSet on Friday, showed the S&P 500 is already trading at 22.2 times 2025 earnings estimates. This is above the five-year average of 19.6 and the 20-year average of 15.8. High valuations and frothy sentiment are among the reasons some have argued the market could be due for a correction, or at least more modest returns going forward. But strategists often point out that high valuations on their own aren't often a reason to sell. \"Multiples are likely to be elevated when investors believe that earnings can grow faster for longer because a recession is less likely in the foreseeable future,\" Yardeni wrote. And as Evercore's Julian Emanuel wrote recently when making the case for the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 by June 2025, \"Expensive has a history of getting more expensive and lasting longer with greater gains.\" He added, \"Exuberance lies ahead. President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

In a blog post, the AI startup underlined that as AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. However, the post added, even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data — trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Anthropic claims that MCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the world's largest social media company, has seen its shares soar nearly 660% over the past decade. That rally was driven by the rapid growth of its core apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp) and its surging ad revenues. It now shares a near-duopoly in the digital advertising market with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google in many countries. During the same decade, Alphabet's shares advanced just over 500%. Most of that growth was fueled by Google's search engine, YouTube, and its cloud platform. Those services -- along with its market-leading Chrome browser, Android mobile OS, Gmail, and other products -- fed plenty of data to its core advertising business. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Yet Google remains an underdog in the cloud infrastructure race, and it failed to leverage its dominance of the search market to launch a lasting social media platform. It also faces some existential challenges: The rise of generative AI search engines like OpenAI's SearchGPT could disrupt its core search business, it faces antitrust probes in multiple markets, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) wants it to sell Chrome. As of this writing, Meta has a market cap of $1.4 trillion while Alphabet is worth $2 trillion. So could the social media king eclipse the struggling search leader's valuation by the end of 2025? Let's dive deeper into these two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to decide. Meta and Alphabet focus on different markets, but they both still generate most of their revenue from digital ads. From 2018 to 2023, Meta's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%, while Alphabet's revenue rose at a CAGR of 18%. Metric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Meta Platforms revenue growth 27% 22% 37% (1%) 16% Alphabet revenue growth 18% 13% 41% 10% 9% Data source: Company earnings reports. In 2020, Meta and Alphabet both struggled with slower ad sales as the pandemic forced many businesses to reduce their marketing expenses. Alphabet partly offset that pressure with Google Cloud's growth. Both companies' ad businesses bounced back in 2021 as the pandemic headwinds waned and the macro environment stabilized. In 2022, both companies generated slower sales growth upon lapping that recovery. However, Meta faced a tougher slowdown after Apple's iOS update allowed its users to opt-out of targeted ads from third-party apps. Stiff competition from ByteDance's TikTok in the short video market exacerbated that pressure. In 2023, Meta's growth accelerated again as it countered Apple's changes with more AI-powered tools for harvesting first-party data, expanded Reels to keep up with TikTok, and attracted big ad purchases from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies. Alphabet's growth cooled off again as Google's advertising business faced tougher macro and competitive challenges. YouTube's growth also slowed down. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16%, and Meta's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 25%. That growth should be driven by the ongoing expansion of Meta's family of apps, which served 3.29 billion daily active people in its latest quarter, and the rollout of new augmented and virtual reality products through its Reality Labs unit. Meta's Reality Labs business is still unprofitable, but it's consistently offsetting those losses with the growth of its higher-margin advertising business. A potential ban or tighter restrictions for TikTok in the U.S. could potentially drive more users toward Reels. Meta also faces some antitrust pressure -- including a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that targets its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp -- but that trial is still in the early stages and not an immediate threat like the DOJ's call for Google to sell Chrome. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 12%, and its EPS to rise at a CAGR of 21%. That outlook assumes the macro environment will warm up, its ad and cloud sales will remain stable, and it won't be significantly disrupted by the generative AI and antitrust challenges. However, those estimates will likely be reduced if the DOJ successfully forces Google to divest Chrome's data-rich business. Alphabet trades at 19 times forward earnings, which makes it the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Meta is still the second cheapest with a forward multiple of 22. Assuming both companies match Wall Street's expectations and still trade at the same forward multiples by the end of 2025, Alphabet's market cap could rise 16% to $191 as Meta's stock climbs 15% to $642. That would boost Alphabet's market cap to $2.4 billion and Meta's market cap to $1.6 trillion. If both stocks trade at 20 times forward earnings by the end of 2025, Alphabet would be worth $2.6 trillion while Meta would still have a market cap of about $1.4 trillion. So unless Alphabet's growth abruptly stalls out over the next few quarters, it seems unlikely that it will be less valuable than Meta by the end of 2025. That said, Meta's stronger growth and milder regulatory headwinds might still make it a better long-term buy than Alphabet. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The world has seen three industrial revolutions, each defined by widespread adoption of new technologies: The first was instigated by steam-powered machines, the second by electricity and telephones, and the third by microprocessors and the internet. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says artificial intelligence is the fourth industrial revolution. Given how profoundly the first three industrial revolutions changed the world, it is no stretch to say the artificial intelligence boom is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors. And Wall Street analysts are broadly bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), as detailed below. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » Among the 67 analyst that follow Alphabet, the median target price is $210 per share. That implies 25% upside from its current share price of $168. Importantly, even the lowest target of $185 per share implies 10% upside. Among the 40 analysts that follow Pinterest, the median target price is $40 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $30. Importantly, even the lowest target of $31 per share implies 3% upside. I mentioned that even the lowest price targets on Alphabet and Pinterest imply upside for shareholders, but there is always risk where the stock market is concerned, so positive returns are never guaranteed. However, it's fair to say most Wall Street analysts view Alphabet and Pinterest as screaming buys. Alphabet is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth across its core advertising and cloud computing businesses. The company already has a strong presence in both markets: It is the largest digital advertiser and third-largest public cloud worldwide. But new AI products could further strengthen its positioning and boost growth. For instance, Alphabet has introduced generative AI overviews in Google Search, and CEO Sundar Pichai says engagement and satisfaction are trending higher. Investment bank Evercore recently conducted a survey that came to the same conclusion, but went one step further in speculating that AI overviews are also generating higher quality leads for advertisers. If true, that could let Alphabet charge more for its ad tech services. In cloud computing, Forrester Research ranks Google as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions, foundational large language models, and machine learning platforms. Also, principle analyst Mike Gualtieri wrote, \"Google is the best positioned hyperscaler for AI.\" Indeed, the company gained two percentage points of market share over the past year, while Amazon and Microsoft both lost share. As a caveat, a federal judge in August ruled Alphabet had engaged in illegal activities to protect its internet search monopoly, and the Justice Department has since recommended that the company be forced to sell its Chrome browser. What promises to be a lengthy appeals process means a resolution may be years away, but certain legal experts have told CNBC the judge will likely impose a less severe remedy. Importantly, history suggests a breakup of the core advertising and cloud computing businesses is highly unlikely. The Justice Department has not successfully broken up a company in 40 years, and the last time a judge attempted to break up a big tech company -- Microsoft in 2000 -- a federal appeals court subsequently reversed the decision. That antitrust issue is weighing on market sentiment right now, but that may change when Alphabet responds with its own proposed remedy on Dec. 20. Regardless, Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.3 times earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a position today. Pinterest is a somewhat unique social media platform in that it prioritizes inspiration over communication. The company considers artificial intelligence a core competency. For instance, machine learning models informed by searches, saves, and clicks generate over 400 million predictions per second to surface relevant content for users. Indeed, CEO Bill Ready recently told analysts that virtually \"all content served on Pinterest, including organic and ads, is powered by AI recommendation models.\" However, the company is also leaning on AI to improve campaign performance for advertisers. Its new Performance+ product bundles AI tools for content generation, budgeting, bidding, and targeting. Management says Performance+ lets brands construct advertising campaigns with half as many inputs. It also reduces cost per action by 10%, meaning brands can achieve the desired outcome while spending a little less money. Performance+ entered general availability in October, and Bill Ready says the company is pleased with the early demand signals from advertisers. Pinterest has another key catalyst in its partnerships with Amazon and Google, which bring demand from third-party advertisers to its platform. The company began collaborating with Amazon in the U.S. last year and recently expanded the relationship to Canada and Mexico. And Pinterest started collaborating with Google earlier this year in previously unmonetized and under-monetized international markets. CEO Bill Ready on the third-quarter earnings call said, \"Both of these partnerships have continued to build sequentially throughout the year, and we expect that trajectory to persist into Q4.\" Importantly, Amazon and Google are two of the three largest ad tech companies in the world, so they represent potentially meaningful sources of demand. That could lead to accelerated earnings growth for Pinterest. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Pinterest's adjusted earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 21.1 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Investors should feel comfortable buying a position in this AI stock today.

As scrutiny around Apple and Google's app store fees ramps up around the world, Roblox is now offering users who buy its game currency, Robux, on the web and via gift cards 25% more than they would get if they purchased from an app store instead. In essence, the company is encouraging users to purchase Robux from the web to avoid Apple and Google's in-app purchase fee markups. The company confirmed the move and said that it is looking for ways to provide more value to user and creator communities. \"Apple and Google are valued partners. We are always looking for ways to pass on more value to our user and creator community while managing costs. Going forward, we are providing up to +25% more Robux for any customer that purchases Robux through the web, computer, or with gift cards,\" a Roblox spokesperson told TechCrunch. In a Roblox developer forum post, Roblox specified that this is not a holiday offer, and is a long-term change. Epic Games' CEO Tim Sweeny, who has been fighting with Apple and Google over app store charges, applauded this move. \"Awesome to see Roblox finally fighting the Apple tax. I hope that the current Epic v Apple contempt of court proceeding stops Apple’s ludicrous scare screens and junk fees so that all apps can send users to web-based payments and pass on the savings like this,\" he said in a post on X. In August, Epic launched its Epic Games Store in the EU on iOS, and on Android across the world. In Europe, companies are looking to launch alternative app stores on iOS, thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Meanwhile, startups like Appcharge are helping publishers sell their games outside of Apple and Google's ecosystems.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stands against the other dividend aristocrat stocks. Investors usually buy stocks with the expectation that their value will increase as the company grows more profitable. However, stocks can offer additional advantages. As businesses succeed and mature, they often choose to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as cash dividends. Even more appealing are companies that not only pay dividends but consistently increase them year after year. These stocks have delivered impressive performance over time compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Thornburg Investment Management, from 1990 to 2023, bond yields, represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, fell significantly from nearly 9% to 3.41%. Similarly, equity yields, reflected by the dividend payouts on the Dividend Aristocrats Index, declined from just over 3% to 2.42% during the same period. The Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks large-cap, blue-chip US companies within the broader market that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. The report further mentioned that dividend-paying stocks can not only offer a source of current income with the potential for growth over time but also help investors bring greater stability to their portfolios in the long run. The report cited Bloomberg’s data and highlighted that dividend aristocrats delivered an 11.63% return to shareholders between 1990 to 2023, compared with a 10.2% return for the broader market. Excluding the aristocrat factor from dividend stocks highlights their significance in overall market returns. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the broader market’s total returns, with the remaining 68% coming from capital appreciation. This demonstrates that both steady dividend income and the potential for capital growth play crucial roles in shaping total return expectations. The report also highlighted the significant impact of compounding when it comes to dividends. Without dividends, the market’s return from January 1, 1930, to the end of July 2023 would have grown to 214%. However, if dividends had been reinvested during the same period, the return would have reached an impressive 7,219%.

Although dividend stocks have lagged in performance this year, companies continue to increase their payouts, reflecting investor preferences steadily. According to a recent report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, 480 dividend increases were recorded in Q3 2024, compared to 448 in Q3 2023, representing a 7.1% year-over-year growth. The total value of these increases for the quarter reached $14.1 billion. Over the past 12 months, dividend increases amounted to $74.7 billion, up from $63.9 billion in the previous year. Our Methodology: For this article, we first listed down all dividend aristocrat stocks — the companies with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them, as per Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The American multinational consumer goods company specializes in a wide range of related products and services. The stock has had an outstanding performance this year, reaching an all-time high of over $177 per share. This achievement is primarily due to the company's strong execution. It has consistently delivered solid results, particularly during inflationary periods, by successfully implementing substantial price increases. For instance, in fiscal 2023, the company posted organic sales growth in every quarter. Since the start of 2024, PG is up by nearly 20%. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported revenue of $21.7 billion, down 1% from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $4.3 billion and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 82%, in line with expectations. It remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning $4.4 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s fiscal 2025 forecast is quite strong, projecting sales growth of 2% to 4% and a diluted net EPS increase of 10% to 12% compared to $6.02 in fiscal 2024. If the company hits the midpoint of this guidance, it will achieve a diluted EPS of $6.68 in fiscal 2025, marking an all-time high in earnings. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a strong dividend payer, with 68 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. In addition, the company has never missed a dividend in 134 years. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.0065 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.26%, as of November 25.

These stakes have a consolidated value of more than $8.8 billion. Among these hedge funds, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PG ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy.

We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\" To prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\" While generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 13% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the largest payment processing company in the US. It holds 52% market share of the US credit card market and 47% of all the outstanding balances. This makes Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) a key player in the US financial system, and it also offers the firm a wide moat over its nearest rival, Mastercard. Like other payment processors, the firm is also dependent on consumer spending since its business model relies on taking a percentage of all transactions as fees. Consequently, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) does well when the economy is strong, and recent economic turmoil has also forced the firm to diversify. During its third quarter, the firm's value-added services revenue and new flows grew by 22% to reduce its dependence on existing customers. However, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)'s payment fee model also creates troubles as evidenced by the $30 billion settlement it and Mastercard have agreed to with merchants. Should merchants switch en-masse from its products, then the firm could face headwinds. Another looming threat is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)'s market share attracting regulatory action. Here's what management had to say during the fiscal Q4 2024 earnings call about one such action against it by the Justice Department: \"Before I close, I wanted to make a few comments on the recent lawsuit by the Department of Justice. We believe the lawsuit is meritless and shows a clear lack of understanding of the payments ecosystem in the United States. Overall, V ranks 19th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +10.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 10.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.67 per share, indicating a change of +10.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.19 points to a change of +11.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.65 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $9.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.3%. The $39.34 billion and $43.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.5% and +9.9%, respectively. Visa reported revenues of $9.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.71 for the same period compares with $2.33 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.17%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data[1] from General Administrator of Customs show that in the first three quarters of 2024, China's cross-border e-commerce import and export volume was 1.88 trillion Yuan, a year-on-year increase of 11.5%, which was 6.2 percentage points higher than China's overall foreign trade growth rate in the same period. According to the \"Visa China Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises Cross-border Payment Pain Points Report\"[2], 50% of companies said they faced the problem of \"uncertainty in accepting accounts\" when making cross-border corporate payments. That is, when companies process cross-border corporate payments, it is impossible to confirm whether the beneficiary receives the money. Followed by 45% of companies believe that \"fee collection cannot be predicted\", 44% of companies think that \"transaction time cannot be predicted\", etc. Security issues such as \"fraud risks in transactions\" and \"processing and investigation of abnormal transaction issues take too long\" are also pain points considered by business owners.

In case you missed it, one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred on Nov. 14. While most investors were honing in on earnings releases and the October inflation report, institutional investors were filing Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F is a required filing for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) that clues investors into which stocks these top-tier money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this case, the September-ended quarter). Though 13F's have their flaws -- since they're filed up to 45 days after the end of a quarter, they may present stale holding data for active hedge funds -- they still provide invaluable insight into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the interest of Wall Street's greatest asset managers. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?  Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free » While Warren Buffett is the most-prominent billionaire money manager on Wall Street, he's far from the only billionaire that investors closely track. For instance, Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors was overseeing $27.4 billion spread across 83 stocks at the end of September. Halvorsen and his team tend to be fairly active, with a focus on the financial, technology, and healthcare sectors. What's perhaps most noteworthy about Halvorsen's third-quarter trading activity is that he disposed of one of Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and absolutely piled into a premier financial company that's skyrocketed since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. Though ringing the register on profitable positions is nothing new for Halvorsen's fund, it may still come as a surprise that Viking Global's brightest minds chose to sell all 2,930,970 shares of AI networking colossus Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) during the third quarter. The excitement surrounding Broadcom's opportunity in the AI arena is thick enough to cut with a knife. The analysts at PwC believe artificial intelligence will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and Broadcom's networking solutions have quickly leaped to the front of the pack in enterprise data centers. Last year, it introduced the Jericho3-AI fabric, which is capable of connecting up to 32,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) in AI-accelerated data centers. Broadcom's tools are designed to maximize the computing potential of GPUs and minimize tail latency. The latter is particularly important for AI-driven software and systems that depend on split-second decision-making. Additionally, Broadcom is much more than just an \"AI stock.\" It's a leading provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. A steady device replacement cycle spurred by wireless providers upgrading their networks to support 5G download speeds has been a growth driver for the company. With so much going Broadcom's way, you might be wondering why Halvorsen and his team cashed in their chips. One possibility is that Viking Global's investment team is acutely aware of history. There hasn't been a game-changing innovation for 30 years that's avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors consistently overestimate the early stage adoption and utility of next-big-thing innovations, which eventually leads to disappointment. If the AI bubble were to burst, it'll undoubtedly be bad news for Broadcom's fastest-growing initiative. Another reason to ring the register is Wall Street's historically expensive valuation. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the third-priciest it's ever been during a bull market, when back-tested to 1871. What's more, the \"Buffett Indicator\" hit its highest reading ever this month. Growth stocks tend to be hit hard during stock market corrections, and a few predictive valuation tools foreshadow trouble to come. Lastly, Broadcom is no longer the smoking-hot bargain it once was. Though shares of the company have averaged a reasonably low forward P/E ratio of 16.5 over the trailing-five-year period, Broadcom is currently valued at a 61% premium to this average. On the other end of the spectrum is a stock Halvorsen couldn't stop buying during the September-ended quarter. I'm talking about globally dominant payment processor Visa (NYSE: V), whose shares have risen by nearly 2,400%, including dividends, since its IPO in March 2008. Among the 23 new purchases made by Viking Global during the third quarter, none was larger than Visa (3,505,747 shares), which became the fund's fifth-largest holding by market value, and its second-largest financial holding, behind only U.S. Bancorp. One of the greatest investing catalysts for financial stocks is that they're able to take advantage of the non-linearity of the economic cycle. While recessions are both normal and inevitable, they're historically short-lived. Since World War II ended in September 1945, only three out of 12 recessions lasted longer than 12 months, and none surpassed 18 months in length. By comparison, most periods of growth have endured multiple years, if not a decade on rare occasion. Financial stocks are able to take advantage of these disproportionately long periods of growth. Another reason investors like Ole Andreas Halvorsen tend to pile into Visa is its dominant role as a payment processor. According to eMarketer, Visa accounted for roughly $6.45 trillion in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. in 2023, which was more than double its next-closest competitor, Mastercard, at $2.73 trillion. Visa is highly unlikely to cede its leading market share in domestic payment processing anytime soon. Furthermore, Visa may be able to sustain double-digit sales and earnings growth for years to come thanks to its international opportunity. For fiscal 2024, which ended Sept. 30, Visa recorded cross-border payment volume growth of 15%! Most emerging markets remain chronically underbanked, which should allow Visa to organically or acquisitively expand its reach in the coming years. Lastly, Visa stock is still inexpensive. Despite its seemingly never-ending rally since its IPO, shares are valued at 24.5 times forward-year earnings. This represents a 14% discount to its average forward P/E ratio over the trailing-five-year period. While Visa is cyclical and susceptible to downside when recessions occur, the company's competitive advantages far outweigh any short-term concerns.

                "title": "Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Stock to Invest in for the Next 3 Months?",
                "content": "We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers. Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil. Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies. Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced. On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes. The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

No. of Hedge Funds: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a global leader in payment processing that enables electronic payments in over 200 countries and territories. The company’s VisaNet processing network enables the authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has also embraced digital wallets, contactless payments, and fraud prevention technologies. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is well positioned to capitalize on the global transition to a cashless society, a shift accelerated by digital transformation trends. While electronic payments have made significant advances, cash remains the dominant transaction method in many emerging markets, offering a considerable avenue for growth. The Federal Reserve reports that in 2024, cash usage accounted for just 16% of transactions, highlighting the growing preference for digital payments, particularly among younger generations. These demographics, notably Gen Z and Millennials, are driving the adoption of mobile and contactless payment solutions, supporting the broader movement toward digital payment systems. Visa Inc.’s (NYSE:V) Consumer Payments segment is working on increasing turnover in the direction of tap-to-pay and click-to-pay services, as well as tokenization. The company is also working on additional revenue growth drivers, such as Visa Direct, commercial solutions for small and medium businesses, and Cross-Border solutions. Overall, V ranks 6th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of V to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
